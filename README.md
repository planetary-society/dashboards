# NASA Data Dashboards

A collection of interactive dashboards created by The Planetary Society to enhance transparency and public understanding of NASA's budget and programmatic activities. These tools transform complex government data into accessible visualizations that inform citizens, researchers, and policymakers about the U.S. space program.

## Mission & Purpose

These dashboards serve as public information resources, making NASA's financial data more accessible and understandable. By aggregating information from multiple government sources and presenting it through interactive visualizations, we aim to foster informed public discourse about space policy, space science, and exploration.

## Data Transparency Approach

### Authoritative Sources
All data is sourced directly from official government databases:
- **DOGE.gov:** Official efficiency initiative reports
- **NASA Procurement Data View:** Contract modification records
- **USAspending.gov:** Federal spending database

### Methodology
Rather than relying on secondary reporting, these dashboards pull information directly from federal databases and cross-reference multiple sources to ensure accuracy. Data is updated regularly via automated processes.

### Verification Process
Each contract or grant flagged for potential cancellation is verified against the official USAspending.gov database to ensure all details—recipient names, funding amounts, dates, and locations—reflect the authoritative federal record.

## Public Impact

### For Citizens
- Understand how federal space spending affects their congressional district
- Track changes in NASA's research priorities and partnerships
- Access exportable data for personal research and analysis

### For Researchers & Journalists
- Comprehensive, searchable database of NASA contract modifications
- Geographic analysis tools for understanding regional impacts
- Citation-ready data with proper attribution

### For Policymakers
- Real-time visibility into programmatic changes
- District-level impact analysis for constituent services
- Historical context for budget planning and oversight

## Technical Implementation

These dashboards are built using Quarto and Python.
