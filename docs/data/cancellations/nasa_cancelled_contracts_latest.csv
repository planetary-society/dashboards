II) what processes are responsible for the non-local effects of southern ocean heat uptake on cloud controlling factors? III) why are salinity-driven ocean heat uptake changes in the southern ocean much more effective in altering clouds than those in other basins? iv) given the exquisite sensitivity of cloud feedback to background salinity, DO natural fluctuations in southern ocean salinity on decadal to centennial timescales result in state-dependent climate sensitivity? v) using sss AS an  emergent constraint, CAN we narrow the estimate of global climate sensitivity? a key resource will be satellite observations of salinity, rainfall and surface wind speed from NASA s aquarius satellite and NASA s soil moisture active-passive (SMAP), complimented BY observations from the European Space Agency s Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite. additional information on the vertical structure of salinity and temperature in the ocean will come from the argo array of profiling floats and from ocean analyses obtained from the NOAA gfdl and NASA geos iodas ocean data assimilation systems. we now have a decade of high-quality global sea surface salinity measurements that could enable a constraint of global cloud feedback using data that is novel and independent of heretofore used methodologies. we propose to explore the detailed mechanisms connecting southern ocean salinity with global cloud feedbacks across the cmip6 ensemble, and design, run and analyze coupled climate model experiments to isolate oceanic and atmospheric pathways to connect the southern ocean with global cloud feedbacks. in particular, it is notable that southern ocean salinity in climate models is connected to both extratropical and tropical/ subtropical cloud feedback differences. we will constrain a climate model's southern ocean salinity to that of other climate models and to that informed from observations. BY completing these tasks, this proposal will directly support the program goals of exploiting satellite salinity measurements and their synergistic use with other observations to investigate salinity variability, particularly NEAR surface salinity stratification, and its linkage the global climate response to increasing greenhouse gases. in doing so, this proposal will directly address the FIRST goal of the Ocean Salinity Science Team.","category_business, corporate_entity_tax_exempt, educational_institution, higher_education, nonprofit, private_institution_of_higher_education",https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_80NSSC22K0999_080/
