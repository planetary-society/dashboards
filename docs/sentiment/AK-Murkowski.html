<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, Senate Committee on Appropriations</li>
<li>Member, Senate Committee on Appropriations: Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Senator Murkowski's strong fiscal conservatism and commitment to spending reductions present a significant challenge for advocating increased NASA space science funding, particularly in light of the proposed FY26 budget cuts. While she holds a key position on the Senate Appropriations Committee, her focus on a wide array of Alaska-specific priorities, from Arctic issues to infrastructure, means NASA science must compete for attention and resources. Her willingness to oppose broad spending measures that do not directly benefit Alaska further indicates a cautious approach to federal outlays.</p>
<p>Despite these hurdles, there are clear opportunities for engagement. Her role on the Senate Appropriations CJS Subcommittee provides a direct channel for influence, and her past expressions of concern for research funding stability could extend to NASA's science programs. Crucially, NASA science directly benefits Alaska through significant grants and contracts to the University of Alaska Fairbanks for Earth science, synthetic aperture radar data management, and space plasma physics research, aligning with her advocacy for climate resiliency and Alaska-centric investments.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider highlighting specific NASA science projects at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, such as synthetic aperture radar data management or space plasma physics research, and how increased investment directly supports Alaskan jobs, scientific expertise, and addresses state-specific challenges like climate change.</li>
<li>Explore framing increased NASA science investment as a fiscally responsible decision that yields significant returns through technological innovation, economic growth, and critical data for climate resilience and resource management, aligning with her emphasis on "smart spending reductions."</li>
<li>Look into emphasizing how stable and increased funding for NASA's science portfolio, particularly Earth science and Arctic research, empowers her influence on the Appropriations Committee to support programs vital for Alaska's future and aligns with her expressed concern for research funding stability.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Lisa Murkowski</h2>
<ul>
<li>Holds a B.A. in economics (Georgetown, 1980) and a J.D. (Willamette, 1985).</li>
<li>Practiced law as an attorney in Anchorage from 1987 to 1998.</li>
<li>Served in the Alaska House of Representatives from 1999 to 2002.</li>
<li>Chaired the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee from 2015-2021.</li>
<li>Co-authored 2024 legislation to ban commercial octopus farming, citing intelligence concerns.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Appropriations Committee Influence:</strong> Senator Murkowski's role as a member of the Senate Committee on Appropriations and its Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee provides direct oversight and influence over NASA's budget, including science activities. She recently voted to advance the FY26 CJS Appropriations Bill through full committee, which funds NASA.</li>
<li><strong>Support for Alaska-based NASA Research:</strong> Senator Murkowski has consistently championed partnerships between the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) and federal agencies, which include significant NASA contracts and grants for Earth science, synthetic aperture radar data management, and space plasma physics research. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for Geosciences and Climate Research:</strong> Senator Murkowski has acknowledged the impacts of climate change on Alaska and has supported federal funding for climate resiliency efforts, stating the need to make communities more resilient to extreme weather events, which often rely on Earth science data and research.</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on Research Funding Stability:</strong> Senator Murkowski has expressed concerns about "unprecedented hits" to research funding and the need for stability for scientists, a principle applicable to NASA's science grants and programs.</li>
<li><strong>Bipartisan Collaboration Potential:</strong> Her vote with Democrats on an amendment related to the Commerce, Justice, Science appropriations bill and her general reputation as a moderate Republican indicate potential for bipartisan collaboration on science funding.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Senator Murkowski identifies as a "tough fiscal conservative" and advocates for "smart spending reductions" to address national debt, which could lead to scrutiny of increased federal spending, including for NASA science.</li>
<li><strong>Broad Competing Priorities:</strong> Her public statements and official website highlight a wide array of priorities for Alaska, including Arctic issues, defense, infrastructure, health, energy, public safety, and tribal affairs, suggesting NASA science may compete with many other pressing issues for her attention and advocacy for increased federal funding.</li>
<li><strong>Alaska-Centric Funding Focus:</strong> Senator Murkowski frequently emphasizes securing federal funding that directly benefits Alaska, such as investments in climate resilience, fisheries research, and workforce development, which may lead her to prioritize NASA science activities with clear, tangible benefits for her state over broader national or international science initiatives.</li>
<li><strong>Skepticism of Omnibus Spending:</strong> She has voted against some federal spending measures, including a short-term continuing resolution in September 2025, stating they were "not serious enough" or lacked critical provisions for Alaska, indicating a willingness to oppose broad funding bills that could impact NASA's budget if they do not align with her specific concerns.</li>
