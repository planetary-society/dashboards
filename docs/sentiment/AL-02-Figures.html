    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.
    All AI-generated claims, assessments, and recommendations should be independently verified.
    This is an experimental feature, and intended to provide guidance and inspiration for outreach strategies for your meeting. Feedback is welcome: casey.dreier@planetary.org.

<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Figures' lack of direct committee influence and his stated legislative priorities, which do not explicitly include NASA space science, suggest he may not proactively champion increased funding. His public record shows limited specific advocacy for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, indicating other issues may take precedence.</p>
<p>However, his support for Marshall Space Flight Center, the presence of NASA science grants at Tuskegee University and the University of South Alabama within his district, and his office's active pursuit of federal grants present clear opportunities. These local investments in Earth science, heliophysics, and broader space exploration research could make him receptive to arguments that increased NASA science funding directly benefits his constituents and district.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching the specific impacts of the NASA science grants at Tuskegee University and the University of South Alabama, highlighting how these investments benefit local education, research, and economic development within his district.</li>
<li>Explore how increased investment in NASA's space science activities aligns with his expressed support for the Marshall Space Flight Center and his interest in "pro-innovation" policies, emphasizing the broader economic and technological benefits for Alabama.</li>
<li>Look into how NASA's Earth science and planetary defense research, as exemplified by grants in his district, directly supports his priorities concerning environmental protection, infrastructure resilience, and educational opportunities for Alabama students.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Shomari Figures</h2>
<ul>
<li>Holds a Bachelor of Arts in criminal justice and history from the University of Alabama.</li>
<li>Earned a Juris Doctor from the University of Alabama School of Law.</li>
<li>Served in the Obama White House Presidential Personnel Office.</li>

</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Support for Marshall Space Flight Center:</strong> Representative Figures joined the Alabama Congressional delegation in a resolution commemorating the 65th anniversary of the Marshall Space Flight Center, affirming support for its mission, programs, and workforce, and highlighting its contributions to American innovation and space exploration.</li>
<li><strong>Investment in Local Earth Science Research:</strong> Tuskegee University, located within his district, received a NASA grant for "Cubes capacity building using cubesats for Earth science," demonstrating direct federal investment in space science activities in his constituency. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Support for University-led Space Weather and Exploration Research:</strong> The University of South Alabama, located in his district, received NASA grants for research on geomagnetic storms (heliophysics/space weather) and for a balanced science program that includes lunar/Mars exploration, Earth science applications, and planetary defense. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Proactive Engagement in Securing Federal Grants:</strong> Representative Figures' office actively provides guidance for "Grant Applicants" and accepts "Appropriations Requests" for community projects and federal programs, indicating a commitment to securing federal funding for his district, which could extend to NASA science initiatives.</li>
<li><strong>Bipartisan Support for Science-Related Legislation:</strong> Representative Figures co-sponsored the bipartisan Enhancing Science, Treatment, and Upkeep of America's Resilient and Important Estuarine Systems (ESTUARIES) Act, which reauthorizes the Environmental Protection Agency's National Estuary Program, demonstrating a willingness to support science-focused legislation and collaborate across the aisle.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of Direct Committee Influence:</strong> Representative Figures does not hold any current space-related committee assignments in the 119th Congress, limiting his direct influence over NASA's budget and policy decisions. (Authoritative Committee Data, 2025-01)</li>
<li><strong>Competing Legislative Priorities:</strong> Representative Figures' public statements and campaign materials consistently emphasize priorities such as healthcare access, education, economic opportunity, infrastructure, and environmental protection (EPA-related), with no explicit mention of NASA's space science or exploration as a top legislative focus. (Mobile Chamber, 2025-08; WSFA, 2024-11; Figures For Congress, 2025-09)</li>
<li><strong>Limited Public Advocacy for NASA Science:</strong> While Representative Figures joined a resolution commemorating the Marshall Space Flight Center, there is no public record of him explicitly championing increased funding or specific initiatives for NASA's Science Mission Directorate or exploration programs. (House.gov, 2025-06)</li>
