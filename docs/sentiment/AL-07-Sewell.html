    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.
    All AI-generated claims, assessments, and recommendations should be independently verified.
    This is an experimental feature, and intended to provide guidance and inspiration for outreach strategies for your meeting. Feedback is welcome: casey.dreier@planetary.org.

<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Sewell's current committee assignments on Ways and Means and House Administration do not provide direct oversight of NASA's budget or science programs, which limits her direct legislative leverage. Her public focus consistently prioritizes other issues like healthcare and economic development, and there is no recent public record of her explicitly advocating for increased NASA science funding, despite local benefits. This suggests she may not immediately prioritize specific advocacy for the Science Mission Directorate.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, significant NASA science grants to the University of Alabama in her district for planetary and Earth science research present a clear opportunity for engagement. Her consistent championing of Alabama's broader space industry, particularly Huntsville's contributions, indicates a general pro-space posture that could be leveraged. Highlighting these direct local benefits and aligning them with her existing support for the space sector could make her receptive to understanding the importance of robust science funding.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching the specific local impacts of the NASA science grants at the University of Alabama, such as job creation, student opportunities, or advancements in local environmental understanding, to personalize the benefits for her constituents.</li>
<li>Explore how increased investment in NASA's science mission contributes to the overall strength and innovation of Alabama's space industry, particularly in Huntsville, reinforcing her advocacy for the state's role in space.</li>
<li>Look into how NASA's Earth science research, particularly on topics like water quality and land-use change funded in her district, directly addresses environmental or economic development concerns that align with her legislative priorities.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Terri A. Sewell</h2>
<ul>
<li>Born in Huntsville, Alabama, a city with a significant aerospace and space industry presence.</li>

</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local NASA Science Research Funding:</strong> The University of Alabama in Representative Sewell's district receives significant NASA grants for science activities, including planetary science research on the Martian crust and Earth science studies related to water quality and land-use change, directly supporting NASA's Science Mission Directorate goals. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for Alabama's Space Industry:</strong> Representative Sewell has consistently championed Huntsville, her birthplace, as a critical hub for the nation's space enterprise, frequently referencing its historical role with NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center and its ongoing contributions to space and missile defense, indicating a general pro-space posture. (U.S. Congresswoman Terri Sewell Press Release, 2025-09; U.S. Congresswoman Terri Sewell Press Release, 2023-05)</li>
<li><strong>District Space Technology Contracts:</strong> Kratos Sre, Inc. in Birmingham, within her district, holds a NASA contract for thermal expansion testing, demonstrating local industry engagement in space-related technology development that supports broader space community efforts. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024; Made in Alabama, 2022-07)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of Direct Committee Oversight:</strong> Representative Sewell's current committee assignments on Ways and Means and House Administration do not provide direct oversight or legislative jurisdiction over NASA's budget or space science programs. (U.S. Congresswoman Terri Sewell, House.gov, 2025-09)</li>
<li><strong>Focus on Competing Priorities:</strong> Representative Sewell's public statements and legislative efforts consistently prioritize issues such as healthcare, economic development, broadband, and civil rights, which may limit her focus on specific advocacy for NASA science and exploration. (U.S. Congresswoman Terri Sewell, House.gov, 2025-09; U.S. Congresswoman Terri Sewell, Press Release, 2022-12; U.S. Congresswoman Terri Sewell, Press Release, 2024-05)</li>
<li><strong>Limited Explicit Advocacy for NASA Science:</strong> Despite significant NASA science grants to institutions in her district, there is no recent public record (within the last 24 months) of Representative Sewell explicitly advocating for increased NASA science funding or specific Science Mission Directorate activities. (U.S. Congresswoman Terri Sewell, Press Releases, 2025-09; USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
