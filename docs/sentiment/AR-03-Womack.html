<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Appropriations</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Womack's strong fiscal conservatism and emphasis on reducing government spending present a significant hurdle for advocating increased NASA science funding, particularly in light of the proposed 47% cut for FY2026. His focus on national security and defense, alongside past support for reducing "green energy initiatives," suggests that new or expanded spending, especially for certain Earth science programs, may face resistance. He has consistently advocated for a more disciplined budget process that prioritizes spending reductions.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, there are reasons for guarded optimism. The University of Arkansas in his district has received substantial NASA grants for Earth science, astrophysics, and planetary science research, directly linking NASA science to local economic and academic benefits. As a member of the House Appropriations Committee, Representative Womack was part of the body that rejected deep overall NASA budget cuts and specifically provided a "lifeline" for the Mars Sample Return program, indicating a willingness to protect critical science missions. Highlighting these local impacts and the importance of preventing drastic cuts to established, high-value science programs will be crucial.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching the specific principal investigators or departments at the University of Arkansas involved in NASA science grants to highlight local expertise and economic benefits directly within his district.</li>
<li>Explore how increased investment in NASA's space science can be framed as a strategic national investment that maintains U.S. leadership in critical technologies and scientific discovery, aligning with his focus on national security and R&amp;D.</li>
<li>Look into specific examples of how NASA science investments yield significant returns on investment or contribute to economic growth and technological innovation, to address his concerns about fiscal responsibility and "unjustifiable spending."</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Steve Womack</h2>
<ul>
<li>Graduated with a B.A. in communications from Arkansas Tech University (1979).</li>
<li>Served in the Arkansas Army National Guard, retiring as a colonel in 2009.</li>
<li>Worked as a radio station manager and financial consultant.</li>
<li>Served as Mayor of Rogers, Arkansas, for 12 years (1998-2010).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local NASA Science Research:</strong> The University of Arkansas in Fayetteville (AR-03) has received multiple NASA grants for science activities, including Earth science, astrophysics, and planetary science research. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>House Appropriations Committee Rejection of Deep NASA Cuts:</strong> As a member of the House Committee on Appropriations, Representative Womack was part of the committee that rejected a proposed 24.3% cut to NASA's overall budget for FY2026, instead maintaining funding at roughly FY2025 levels. (SpacePolicyOnline.com, 2025-09-11)</li>
<li><strong>Support for Specific Planetary Science Missions:</strong> The House Appropriations Committee, of which Representative Womack is a member, provided a $300 million "lifeline" for the Mars Sample Return program in the FY2026 appropriations bill and supported the continued operation of the New Horizons mission. (SpacePolicyOnline.com, 2025-09-11)</li>
<li><strong>Endorsement of Local R&amp;D Investment:</strong> Representative Womack supported the FY2026 Defense Appropriations bill, which included investments in critical research and development programs conducted in Northwest Arkansas. (U.S. Congressman Steve Womack, 2025-06-12)</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for Local NASA Exploration Partnerships:</strong> In 2022, Representative Womack publicly celebrated Canoo, a company with facilities in Northwest Arkansas, being selected by NASA to provide a transportation fleet for Artemis astronauts, highlighting local involvement in NASA's broader mission. (YouTube, 2022-04-27)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Representative Womack has expressed concerns about "unjustifiable spending" and the government's "unsustainable fiscal trajectory," advocating for reducing spending in appropriations bills.</li>
<li><strong>Prioritization of National Security and Defense:</strong> As a member of the House Appropriations Committee, Representative Womack's public statements and votes on appropriations legislation frequently emphasize strengthening national security, defense, and related infrastructure, indicating these areas may take precedence in budget allocations.</li>
<li><strong>Opposition to "Green Energy Initiatives":</strong> Representative Womack supported an FY26 appropriations bill that included a $1.6 billion reduction in funding for "green energy initiatives," which could signal a cautious approach to certain climate-related aspects of NASA Earth science.</li>
<li><strong>Criticism of Budget Process:</strong> As a member of the House Appropriations Committee, he has consistently criticized the "broken budget process" and the use of continuing resolutions, advocating for a more disciplined and timely appropriations process, which may lead to resistance against new or expanded spending outside of a structured budget.</li>
