    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.

<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Biggs's consistent focus on federal spending cuts and skepticism towards climate science present significant challenges for advocating increased NASA science funding, particularly for Earth science missions. His lack of space-related committee assignments also limits his direct influence on NASA's budget, and he has not explicitly advocated for overall NASA science growth.</p>
<p>However, his recent sponsorship of the Space Research Innovation Act, aimed at deep space research through university partnerships, indicates a potential receptiveness to specific types of scientific investment. Advocates can highlight the direct economic benefits of NASA's planetary science activities in his district, such as the $17.3 million VIPER rover contract for Moog Military Aircraft LLC in Gilbert, and his past strong support for university-led missions, which he has called "money well spent" for exploration and innovation.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching the specific economic impact of the Moog Military Aircraft LLC and Miracorp Inc contracts within his district, highlighting how increased NASA science funding could directly expand these local job-creating opportunities and align with his support for university-led missions and the Space Research Innovation Act.</li>
<li>Explore how to frame increased NASA science investment as a fiscally responsible decision that yields significant returns on investment for the nation and Arizona, focusing on job creation, technological innovation, and national competitiveness, which may resonate with his concerns about federal spending.</li>
<li>Look into personal stories from constituents in his district who work on NASA-related projects or benefit from space science, connecting these narratives to his interest in Arizona's role in the broader space sector and its universities' contributions to tech growth.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Andy Biggs</h2>
<ul>
<li>Earned a B.A. in Asian Studies, a J.D., and an M.A. in Political Science.</li>
<li>Worked as a lawyer and prosecutor before entering public service.</li>
<li>Served in the Arizona House of Representatives and State Senate.</li>
<li>Elected U.S. Representative for Arizona's 5th congressional district in 2016.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Sponsorship of Space Research Innovation Act:</strong> Representative Biggs sponsored H.R. 108, the "Space Research Innovation Act," introduced on January 3, 2025, which aims to enable NASA to establish a research center for deep space and interplanetary research through university partnerships. This legislation would directly benefit Arizona universities, such as Arizona State University, which he has previously highlighted for its contributions to space research.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support for University-Led Missions:</strong> In 2018, Representative Biggs expressed strong support for university-led NASA missions, noting their efficiency and success, and specifically cited the $800 million combined budget for ASU's Psyche and UofA's OSIRIS-REx missions as "money well spent" for learning and exploration. This indicates a positive view of NASA science conducted through academic partnerships, which could benefit Arizona's research institutions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Local NASA Science Contracts:</strong> Companies within Representative Biggs's district have received significant contracts for NASA science missions, such as Moog Military Aircraft LLC in Gilbert, AZ, which was awarded $17.3 million for the Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (VIPER) Rover Integrated Avionics Unit. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024) This demonstrates a direct economic benefit to his constituents from NASA's planetary science activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Advocacy for Arizona's Role in Space:</strong> In November 2020, Representative Biggs joined other Arizona lawmakers in advocating for the state to host the permanent headquarters of the U.S. Space Command, indicating a general interest in expanding Arizona's role in the broader space sector and its associated economic development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Engagement with University Research and Innovation:</strong> Representative Biggs participated in an Arizona State University event in August 2025, discussing energy innovation and emphasizing Arizona's potential as a leader in tech growth and the role of its universities, including ASU's "mega engineering school," in providing a skilled workforce. This engagement highlights his support for university research and technological advancement, which can align with NASA's scientific and technological goals.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ideological Opposition to Government Spending:</strong> Representative Biggs consistently advocates for significant federal spending cuts to address the national debt, viewing it as a critical threat, which may extend to discretionary spending for NASA science.</li>
<li><strong>Opposition to Climate and Earth Science Funding:</strong> He has publicly questioned mainstream climate science and recently supported cuts to the Clean Technology Fund, indicating potential resistance to NASA's Earth science activities.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Explicit Advocacy for NASA Science Growth:</strong> Public records do not show explicit statements or actions by Representative Biggs advocating for increased investment in NASA's Science Mission Directorate or exploration programs. (No public record found)</li>
<li><strong>Absence from Space-Related Committees:</strong> Representative Biggs holds no current space-related committee assignments in the 119th Congress, limiting his direct influence on NASA policy and budget decisions. (Authoritative Committee Data)</li>
<li><strong>Voting Record Against Continuing Resolutions:</strong> Representative Biggs voted against the "Continuing Appropriations Act, 2024 and Other Extensions Act," which averted a government shutdown, demonstrating a willingness to oppose spending measures even if they maintain current funding levels.</li>
