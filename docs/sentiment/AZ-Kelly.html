<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, Planetary Science Caucus</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Senator Mark Kelly's extensive background as a retired NASA astronaut and his current leadership in advocating for $9 billion for NASA's Science Mission Directorate position him as a potential champion for increased space science funding. While the proposed 47% budget cut for FY2026 presents a significant challenge, his demonstrated opposition to cuts and membership in the Planetary Science Caucus indicate a strong personal and policy alignment with these goals.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Arizona's substantial receipt of NASA Science contracts and grants, particularly for major planetary science and astrophysics missions at institutions like the University of Arizona and Arizona State University, provides a compelling local economic and research incentive for his support. Despite the uphill battle against deep proposed cuts, these factors suggest Senator Kelly will likely be receptive to advocacy for robust investment in NASA's science programs.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider preparing a brief personal story about how NASA's space science has impacted you or your community, directly connecting to Senator Kelly's own deep experience as a NASA astronaut and his stated support for the Science Mission Directorate.</li>
<li>Explore specific examples of how NASA science investments, particularly those at the University of Arizona and Arizona State University, directly benefit Arizona's economy, jobs, and educational opportunities, aligning with Senator Kelly's emphasis on local impact.</li>
<li>Look into Senator Kelly's work with the Planetary Science Caucus and his bipartisan efforts on planetary defense, identifying how increased NASA science investment can further these specific areas of interest and benefit national security.</li>
</ul>
