    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.
    All AI-generated claims, assessments, and recommendations should be independently verified.
    This is an experimental feature, and intended to provide guidance and inspiration for outreach strategies for your meeting. Feedback is welcome: casey.dreier@planetary.org.

<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Kiley's public record primarily emphasizes support for the commercial space industry and deregulation, rather than explicit advocacy for NASA's Science Mission Directorate. His fiscal conservative stance and lack of a space-related committee assignment may lead to caution regarding increased federal spending on NASA science programs, especially given the limited direct economic ties to NASA science within his district.</p>
<p>However, his strong advocacy for intellectual property protections, investment in AI research, and general pro-innovation stance suggest a potential openness to arguments that frame NASA science as a driver of technological advancement and national leadership. The presence of a local contract for CMOS silicon pixel detectors, relevant to space science instrumentation, offers a specific point of connection to district interests that could be leveraged in discussions about increased investment.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching the specific applications and economic impact of the CMOS silicon pixel detector contract awarded to Tsi Semiconductors America LLC in Roseville, CA, to highlight a direct local benefit of NASA science investment in his district.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's space science missions drive innovation in areas like artificial intelligence, advanced materials, and intellectual property development, aligning with Representative Kiley's stated support for cutting-edge research and strong IP protections.</li>
<li>Look into examples of how foundational NASA science research has historically enabled and continues to support the growth of the commercial space industry, demonstrating how public investment in science complements and strengthens private sector endeavors.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Kevin Kiley</h2>
<ul>
<li>Graduated from Harvard University (2007) and Yale Law School.</li>
<li>Taught in Los Angeles through Teach for America.</li>
<li>Practiced law, including intellectual property theft cases.</li>
<li>Served in the California State Assembly from 2016 to 2022.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Local Technology Investment:</strong> Representative Kiley's district, CA-03, has received a NASA contract for CMOS silicon pixel detectors, indicating a local economic interest in advanced technology relevant to space science instrumentation. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Intellectual Property Advocacy:</strong> As a member of the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property, and the Internet, Representative Kiley has championed legislation like the bipartisan Patent Eligibility Restoration Act, emphasizing strong intellectual property protections as crucial for innovation and economic growth across various technological fields. (Tillis, Coons, Kiley, and Peters, 2025-05-01; CSIS, 2023-12-12)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support for Commercial Space:</strong> Representative Kiley has publicly supported the commercial space industry, including SpaceX, and introduced the "New Space Age Act" to streamline regulatory oversight, viewing it as essential for American innovation and leadership in space exploration. (Rep. Kiley Press Release, 2024-12-06; Teslarati, 2024-09-26)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Investment in AI Research:</strong> Representative Kiley co-sponsored the bipartisan "Ensuring Safe and Ethical AI Development Through SAFE AI Research Grants Act," demonstrating support for federal funding in cutting-edge scientific research, which has increasing relevance to space science data analysis and mission operations. (Rep. Kiley Press Release, 2023-10-26; Mintz, 2023-10-26)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pro-Innovation Stance:</strong> Representative Kiley consistently advocates for policies that reduce bureaucracy and foster innovation, stating that "when America innovates, America wins," suggesting a general openness to investments that drive technological advancement and national leadership, including in scientific endeavors. (Rep. Kiley Press Release, 2024-11-19; YouTube, 2024-11-22)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Limited Direct Advocacy for NASA Science:</strong> Representative Kiley's public record primarily highlights support for commercial space industry deregulation and national security applications of space, rather than explicit advocacy for NASA's Science Mission Directorate activities.</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on Commercial Sector-led Space:</strong> His legislative efforts to streamline commercial space launch regulations and his praise for private companies like SpaceX suggest a preference for private sector-driven space development, which may not translate to increased investment in government-led NASA science.</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservative Stance:</strong> Representative Kiley has supported significant tax relief measures, indicating a general fiscal conservative approach that could lead to caution regarding increased federal spending, including for NASA science programs.</li>
<li><strong>Absence of Space-Related Committee Role:</strong> Representative Kiley does not hold any current space-related committee assignments, which limits his direct influence and formal opportunities to champion NASA's science and exploration budgets. (Authoritative Committee Data)</li>
<li><strong>Limited Local NASA Science Economic Ties:</strong> The provided contract data shows only one direct NASA Science Mission Directorate-related contract within CA-03, potentially reducing local economic incentives for increased NASA science funding. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
