    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.
    All AI-generated claims, assessments, and recommendations should be independently verified.
    This is an experimental feature, and intended to provide guidance and inspiration for outreach strategies for your meeting. Feedback is welcome: casey.dreier@planetary.org.

<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Thompson's broad legislative focus and lack of space-related committee assignments suggest that advocating for increased NASA space science funding may not be an immediate top priority. There is no public record of him explicitly championing higher investment in this area, indicating a need for direct engagement.</p>
<p>However, his district benefits significantly from NASA Science Mission Directorate activities, including substantial contracts and grants for Earth science research, advanced technology development, and STEM education. Highlighting how a proposed 47% cut to NASA Science in FY26 would directly impact these local institutions, jobs, and scientific advancements could provide a compelling, localized argument for his support.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider highlighting how NASA's science investments directly support local jobs and economic growth in CA-04, potentially connecting to Representative Thompson's background in local business or public administration.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's Earth science missions, particularly those with local district involvement like the Bay Area Environmental Research Institute and UC Davis, provide critical data and insights relevant to California's environmental challenges.</li>
<li>Look into the impact of NASA's STEM education investments, such as the significant grant to Sonoma State University, on developing the future workforce and providing opportunities for underserved populations in his district.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Mike Thompson</h2>
<ul>
<li>Served in the U.S. Army's 173rd Airborne Brigade during the Vietnam War.</li>
<li>Educated at California State University, Chico.</li>
<li>Professional background includes vineyard owner and maintenance supervisor.</li>
<li>Taught Public Administration and State Government at two California State Universities.</li>
<li>Previously served in the California State Senate before his election to Congress.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local Earth Science Investment:</strong> Significant NASA contracts and grants to entities in Representative Thompson's district for Earth science research and technology development demonstrate a direct local economic and scientific stake in NASA's Science Mission Directorate. Remote Sensing Systems (Santa Rosa, CA) received over $6.2M for Earth science algorithm development and sensor evaluation, while the Bay Area Environmental Research Institute (Sonoma, CA) received a $137.8M grant for environmental research, and the University of California, Davis (Davis, CA) received grants totaling $2.6M for satellite observation recasting and hyperspectral imagers for Earth missions.</li>
<li><strong>Advanced Space Technology Development:</strong> NASA grants to local institutions for developing innovative space technologies, such as new telescope concepts, indicate a local interest in the technological advancements driven by NASA's science and exploration programs. The University of California, Davis (Davis, CA) received a $1.5M grant to demonstrate a new telescope concept (SPIDER) for low-mass, low-volume imaging, which has benefits for NASA missions.</li>
<li><strong>STEM Workforce Development:</strong> A substantial NASA grant aimed at enabling STEM education in Representative Thompson's district highlights a commitment to building the future scientific and technical workforce essential for NASA's missions. Sonoma State University (Rohnert Park, CA) received a $5.5M grant to enable STEM education for underserved populations.</li>
<li><strong>Local Engagement in Space Microelectronics:</strong> Contracts for radiation testing of microelectronics and photonics in his district show local involvement in critical components for space missions, which are integral to the success of NASA's science instruments. The University of California, Davis (Davis, CA) received a $30K contract to provide radiation testing of microelectronics and photonics.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competing Legislative Priorities:</strong> Representative Thompson's official websites consistently highlight a broad array of legislative priorities, including jobs, economy, healthcare, gun violence prevention, and environment, which may overshadow specific advocacy for increased NASA science investment.</li>
<li><strong>No Space-Related Committee Assignment:</strong> Representative Thompson holds no current space-related committee assignments in the 119th Congress, limiting his direct legislative platform for space policy. (Provided Data, 2025)</li>
<li><strong>Absence from Appropriations Committee:</strong> Representative Thompson is not a member of the House Committee on Appropriations, which directly oversees federal spending, including NASA's budget.</li>
<li><strong>Generalist Legislative Focus:</strong> Representative Thompson's biography and public record indicate a broad legislative focus across various policy areas, rather than a specialized emphasis on science or space policy. (Provided Data, 2025)</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Explicit Advocacy for Increased Science Investment:</strong> No public record was found of recent explicit statements from Representative Thompson specifically advocating for increased investment in NASA's space science activities beyond current funding levels. (No public record found)</li>
