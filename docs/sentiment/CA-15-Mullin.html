    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.
    All AI-generated claims, assessments, and recommendations should be independently verified.

<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, Planetary Science Caucus</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Mullin demonstrates a clear interest in space science, evidenced by his membership in the Congressional Planetary Science Caucus and co-introduction of the MACH Act, which supports scientific experiments. His concern for continued U.S. access to Low Earth Orbit for R&amp;D also highlights an understanding of the infrastructure needed for scientific progress. Furthermore, a substantial $182.7 million NASA contract for Safety and Mission Assurance Services in his district directly supports the operational success of spacecraft and instruments, establishing a strong local connection to NASA's overall mission, including its scientific endeavors.</p>
<p>However, advocates should be aware that Representative Mullin's public statements frequently prioritize pressing domestic issues like affordable housing and healthcare, which may compete for his attention and legislative focus. While the district benefits from significant NASA contracts, the largest is for mission assurance rather than direct science funding, and overall direct science spending in the district is modest. Despite these competing priorities, his demonstrated interest in science-based solutions and existing ties to NASA's broader mission suggest he may be receptive to arguments that connect robust science funding to American innovation, economic competitiveness, and the long-term health of the space enterprise.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching the specific types of jobs and economic contributions that Ares Technical Services Corporation's $182.7 million NASA contract brings to his district, highlighting how these local benefits are tied to the success and safety of NASA's science missions.</li>
<li>Explore how specific, impactful NASA science missions or discoveries align with his membership in the Congressional Planetary Science Caucus and his advocacy for "American innovations in science and technology," potentially sharing a personal story about the inspiration or benefits of such science.</li>
<li>Look into how NASA's science investments, beyond direct contracts, contribute to broader technological advancements, workforce development, or inspire STEM education in ways that could indirectly support his stated priorities like economic development or innovative solutions for societal challenges.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Kevin Mullin</h2>
<ul>
<li>Received degrees in Communications and Public Administration.</li>
<li>Entrepreneur; founded a multimedia production business.</li>
<li>Served on South San Francisco City Council, including Mayor.</li>
<li>Served 10 years in California State Assembly, including Speaker pro tempore.</li>
<li>Demonstrates interest in planetary science.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Planetary Science Caucus Membership:</strong> Representative Mullin is a member of the Congressional Planetary Science Caucus, indicating a direct interest in space science, research, and exploration.</li>
<li><strong>Support for NASA Program Authorization:</strong> He co-introduced the Making Advancements in Commercial Hypersonics (MACH) Act in January 2025, which authorizes a NASA program to support scientific experiments through high-speed flights with commercial companies, stating that "American innovations in science and technology have lasting impacts."</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for Continued Space R&amp;D Infrastructure:</strong> In July 2024, Representative Mullin introduced an amendment to the NASA Reauthorization Act of 2024, requiring NASA to report on the risk of a potential gap in U.S. access to Low Earth Orbit (LEO) after the ISS retirement, highlighting concerns for R&amp;D.</li>
<li><strong>Local Economic Ties to NASA Missions:</strong> Ares Technical Services Corporation in Burlingame, CA, within his district, received a $182.7 million NASA contract for Safety and Mission Assurance Services supporting spacecraft and instruments, demonstrating a local connection to NASA's operational and scientific success. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Broader Support for Science-Based Solutions:</strong> Representative Mullin has publicly advocated for investing in "innovative, science-based solutions" to address climate change and enhance global competitiveness, and co-led bipartisan requests for increased research funding in related scientific areas.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competing Legislative Priorities:</strong> Representative Mullin's official website and public statements frequently highlight legislative priorities such as affordable housing, healthcare access, and economic development for his district, which may limit his capacity to actively champion increased investment in NASA science activities over other pressing domestic issues.
