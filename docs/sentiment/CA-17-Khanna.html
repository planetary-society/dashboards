<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Khanna has a strong record of advocating for federal investment in science and technology, co-authoring the CHIPS and Science Act and supporting emerging biotechnology, which aligns with NASA's broader scientific mission and has brought significant contracts to his district. His past statements referencing NASA's role in Silicon Valley's development and support for Earth and climate science also suggest a potential receptiveness to specific NASA science initiatives.</p>
<p>However, his focus on fiscal scrutiny, reducing "wasteful spending," and a broad legislative agenda encompassing many domestic priorities could make securing increased funding for NASA science challenging, especially given the proposed FY2026 cuts. His lack of direct committee assignments related to space may also limit his proactive engagement on this specific issue, requiring advocates to clearly demonstrate how NASA science investments align with his priorities for economic patriotism and efficient, impactful federal spending.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching how specific NASA science initiatives, particularly those with contracts in his district, directly contribute to the goals of the CHIPS and Science Act or advance emerging biotechnology, highlighting local job creation and technological leadership.</li>
<li>Explore personal stories from constituents in his district who have benefited from NASA science contracts or related technological advancements, demonstrating how these investments align with his focus on "economic patriotism" and efficient, impactful federal spending.</li>
<li>Look into specific examples of how NASA's science investments have historically fueled technological innovation in Silicon Valley, and how continued funding can support the growth of new industries and intellectual property within his district today.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Ro Khanna</h2>
<ul>
<li>Holds a B.A. in Economics (University of Chicago) and J.D. (Yale Law School).</li>
<li>Practiced intellectual property law, representing technology companies in Silicon Valley.</li>
<li>Served as Deputy Assistant Secretary in the U.S. Department of Commerce.</li>
<li>Co-authored the Endless Frontier Act, a major investment in science and chip manufacturing.</li>
<li>Appointed to the National Security Commission on Emerging Biotechnology.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Support for CHIPS and Science Act:</strong> Representative Khanna co-authored the Endless Frontier Act, which formed the basis for the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, a law enacted in August 2022 that includes significant investments in science and technology research, including areas relevant to NASA's science mission. His office announced $100 million in CHIPS Act funding for Applied Materials in Santa Clara, CA, within his district, in November 2024. [cite: 3, 8, 10, 2024-11]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Engagement with Emerging Biotechnology:</strong> As a member of the bipartisan National Security Commission on Emerging Biotechnology, Representative Khanna actively works to advance U.S. innovation in biotechnology, a field with applications in NASA's biological and physical sciences, and co-introduced the National Biotechnology Initiative Act of 2025 in April 2025. [cite: 9, 11, 13, 17, 2025-04]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Advocacy for Broad Science and Technology Investment:</strong> Representative Khanna has consistently advocated for substantial federal investment in research and development across various emerging technologies, emphasizing the importance of U.S. leadership in science and innovation, and in April 2025, he referenced NASA's historical role in fostering Silicon Valley's tech development. [cite: 6, 19, 2025-04]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support for Earth and Climate Science:</strong> Representative Khanna has expressed support for investments in climate science and green technology, aligning with NASA's Earth Science mission to monitor and understand our planet, and discussed the CHIPS and Science Act's contributions to climate policy in June 2023. [cite: 3, 18, 2023-06]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Direct NASA Contracts in District:</strong> Companies within Representative Khanna's district have received significant NASA contracts for advanced scientific and technological development, demonstrating a direct local economic and research interest in NASA's activities, including Aosense, Inc. for gravity gradiometer technology and Banpil Photonics, Inc. for Earth's radiation budget detector. [cite: USAspending, FY2022-FY2024]</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competing Legislative Priorities:</strong> Representative Khanna's broad legislative agenda, which includes healthcare, social equity, and economic reforms, may lead to space science not being a top-tier priority for increased funding compared to other "essential programs for ordinary Americans" highlighted in his progressive deficit reduction plan. (Common Dreams, 2025-06-10)</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal Scrutiny and Anti-Wasteful Spending Stance:</strong> Representative Khanna consistently advocates for reducing wasteful government spending, particularly in the defense budget, and has proposed a plan to cut the deficit by $12 trillion, which could lead to scrutiny of all federal spending, including NASA's, if not clearly aligned with his vision for "economic patriotism" and efficient investment. (Common Dreams, 2025-06-10; Common Dreams, 2023-06-22; Ro Khanna, 2023-08-28; Fox News, 2024-12-10; YouTube, 2025-02-06; Ro Khanna, 2022-06-22)</li>
<li><strong>Absence of Direct Space Committee Assignment:</strong> Representative Khanna does not hold any current space-related committee assignments in the 119th Congress, which may limit his direct influence and proactive advocacy for NASA's space science activities within the legislative process.
