<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology</li>
<li>Member, House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology: Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Fong has demonstrated a clear interest in NASA's scientific and technological advancements, particularly when they connect to local assets like NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center. His authorship of the ACERO Act, championing of the MACH Program, and co-sponsorship of interagency research coordination all indicate support for scientific endeavors, especially those with Earth science applications or ties to aerospace development. Furthermore, his public statements affirm a commitment to ensuring NASA has the necessary resources and to investing in space and science for national and economic security.</p>
<p>However, advocates should be prepared to address potential reservations stemming from his emphasis on fiscal conservatism and efficient government spending. While his district benefits from overall NASA spending, direct economic ties from active science programs appear limited, which may reduce a direct incentive for broad science funding increases. His focus within the Science, Space, and Technology Committee has also leaned towards national security and commercial space partnerships, suggesting that arguments for increased science funding might be more persuasive if framed with a clear connection to national security, economic competitiveness, or tangible local benefits.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching specific NASA science initiatives, especially those related to Earth science applications or hypersonics, that could directly benefit or involve NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center in his district, linking them to local economic development or regional challenges like wildfire response.</li>
<li>Explore how increased investment in NASA's science activities aligns with fiscal responsibility by highlighting economic returns, technological spin-offs, or efficient program management that maximizes taxpayer value.</li>
<li>Look into how NASA's foundational science research directly contributes to national security, maintains U.S. leadership in critical technologies, and fosters the skilled workforce essential for long-term economic growth, aligning with his broader statements on space investment.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Vince Fong</h2>
<ul>
<li>Earned a political science degree from UCLA and a master's in public affairs from Princeton.</li>
<li>Served as an aide to Congressman Bill Thomas, focusing on international trade policy.</li>
<li>Worked nearly a decade as District Director for then-Congressman Kevin McCarthy.</li>
<li>Represented parts of the Central Valley in the California State Assembly for eight years.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Support for NASA Reauthorization:</strong> Representative Fong voted for the NASA Reauthorization Act of 2024, which passed the House with bipartisan support and reauthorizes NASA's programs, including those for Earth science and space exploration. (Congressman Vince Fong, 2024-09-24; Congress.gov, 2024-09-23)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Authorship of ACERO Act:</strong> Representative Fong introduced the bipartisan Advanced Capabilities for Emergency Response Operations (ACERO) Act, which leverages NASA's innovative technology, developed at NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center in his district, to enhance Earth science applications for wildfire response. (Congressman Vince Fong, 2025-06-11)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Introduction of MACH Program:</strong> Representative Fong championed the Making Advancements in Commercial Hypersonics (MACH) Program, which authorizes NASA to support scientific experiments through high-speed flights, explicitly stating it helps NASA achieve its scientific goals and builds on the successful Flight Opportunities Program. The program aims to nurture aerospace technology developments locally at NASA Armstrong and in East Kern County. (Congressman Vince Fong, 2024-09-24; House.gov, 2025-01-16)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Co-sponsorship of DOE and NASA Interagency Research Coordination Act:</strong> Representative Fong co-sponsored the DOE and NASA Interagency Research Coordination Act, which provides statutory authority for collaborative research and development between the two agencies, including in areas like dark matter, directly benefiting NASA's science mission directorate. (Congress.gov, 2025-02-14)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Public Statements on NASA Resources:</strong> Representative Fong has publicly stated his commitment to ensuring "NASA has the resources to achieve their mission" and emphasized the importance of "rapidly investing in space and science development" for national and economic security. (Payload Space, 2025-07-08)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Emphasis on fiscal conservatism:</strong> Representative Fong has publicly stated his commitment to reining in government spending and ensuring fiscal responsibility, which may lead to scrutiny of federal appropriations, including those for NASA science.</li>
<li><strong>Competing legislative priorities:</strong> Representative Fong's public statements and press releases frequently highlight priorities such as water infrastructure, energy policy, border security, and economic growth, indicating a broad legislative focus that may compete with increased investment in NASA science.</li>
<li><strong>Limited direct economic ties to active NASA science/exploration:</strong> The provided contracts for CA-20 related to NASA are minimal, with one for $0 for aircraft storage/parts removal and another for $39K for gauges, indicating a lack of significant active NASA science or exploration program economic presence in the district. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Focus on national security and commercial space within committee role:</strong> As a member of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, Representative Fong has emphasized advocating for advanced research in industries, promoting innovative technologies, and working on legislation for public-private partnerships in the space and aviation arena, with a particular focus on national defense and commercial spaceflight, rather than explicitly prioritizing NASA's science mission directorate activities.</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on oversight and efficiency:</strong> Representative Fong has supported legislation aimed at preventing government shutdowns and has emphasized the importance of rigorous oversight to ensure efficient and effective use of taxpayer dollars, which may prioritize scrutiny of spending over advocating for increased investment in NASA science.</li>
