    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.
    All AI-generated claims, assessments, and recommendations should be independently verified.

<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Costa may present a challenge for advocates seeking increased NASA space science funding. His congressional focus heavily prioritizes agriculture, water infrastructure, healthcare, and housing, with no direct committee assignments related to space or science. Furthermore, the absence of any NASA Science Mission Directorate contracts or grants in his district means there is no direct economic incentive for local support of these activities, suggesting space science may not be a primary legislative concern.</p>
<p>However, there are potential avenues for engagement. His strong advocacy for agricultural research, climate investments, and federal scientific assessment, such as the supercomputer for climate-resilient food supply chains, indicates a general receptiveness to science that addresses practical challenges. Framing NASA's Earth science programs, which monitor climate, water resources, and agricultural conditions, as vital tools for his district's priorities could resonate, especially when considering the impact of a proposed 47% budget cut on critical scientific capabilities.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching specific examples of how NASA's Earth science data and research contribute to climate-resilient agriculture, water resource management, or environmental monitoring in California's Central Valley, aligning with his local project funding requests and agricultural focus.</li>
<li>Explore how broader investments in NASA science, beyond direct contracts, foster innovation, workforce development, and STEM education that could indirectly benefit the Central Valley's future economy and address "bread and butter" concerns.</li>
<li>Look into how NASA science investments can be framed as supporting broader national priorities or the work of other federal agencies that Representative Costa champions, providing a compelling, indirect rationale for his support given his legislative experience.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Jim Costa</h2>
<ul>
<li>Graduated from California State University, Fresno with a BA in Political Science (1974).</li>
<li>Worked as a congressional aide for Representatives Sisk and Krebs, focusing on Central Valley policy.</li>
<li>Served 24 years in the California State Legislature (Assembly and Senate).</li>
<li>Grew up working on a family farm; parents were dairy farmers in California.</li>
<li>No direct professional or educational background in STEM or space policy found.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Support for Federal Science and Technology Research:</strong> Representative Costa co-sponsored the "Unleashing Low-Cost Rural AI Act" in September 2025, which directs a National Laboratory to study the impacts of AI data centers on energy and water use and to evaluate alternative energy sources, demonstrating support for federal scientific assessment.</li>
<li><strong>Local Connection to Science and Technology:</strong> His FY2025 Community Project Funding requests include funds for a supercomputer for climate-resilient food supply chain research at the F3 Innovate hub in the San Joaquin Valley, indicating a direct interest in local science and technology investment.</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for Agricultural Research and Conservation:</strong> His bid for Ranking Member of the House Agriculture Committee in November 2024, supported by organizations citing his commitment to agricultural research, suggests a posture favorable to science that informs agricultural practices and resource management.</li>
<li><strong>Commitment to Climate and Environmental Investments:</strong> Representative Costa championed the Inflation Reduction Act, securing $15 million for a solar panel project over the Delta-Mendota Canal, and advocates for federal investments to reduce emissions, expand clean energy, and prevent wildfires, aligning with Earth science objectives.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>No Space-Related Committee Assignments:</strong> Representative Costa holds no current committee assignments directly related to space or science in the 119th Congress, limiting his direct legislative influence on NASA's budget and policy. (Ballotpedia, 2023-2024; Congress.gov, 2023-2024)</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Direct District Economic Ties:</strong> No relevant NASA Science Mission Directorate contracts or grants have been identified for California's 21st Congressional District, indicating an absence of direct economic incentives for local support of these activities. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Competing Legislative Priorities:</strong> Representative Costa's official legislative priorities and community project funding requests for FY2023 and FY2024 emphasize agriculture, water infrastructure, healthcare, housing, and public safety, with no explicit mention of space science or exploration. (House.gov, 2025; House.gov, 2024; House.gov, 2023)</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on "Bread and Butter" Issues:</strong> Representative Costa has publicly prioritized "bread and butter" issues such as healthcare, food security, and housing stability, and has criticized budget proposals that would cut vital relief for families, suggesting these social and local economic needs may take precedence in his federal spending considerations. (Congressman Jim Costa, 2025-05; YouTube, 2025-06)</li>
<li><strong>Limited Public Advocacy for Space Science:</strong> The public record shows a limited number of recent statements or legislative actions specifically advocating for NASA's Science Mission Directorate activities or exploration programs, indicating these may not be a primary focus of his congressional work. (Congress.gov, 2023-2024)</li>
