<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Appropriations</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Valadao's strong emphasis on fiscal conservatism and reducing federal spending presents a significant challenge for advocating increased NASA science funding, especially given the proposed FY26 cuts. His district currently lacks direct economic ties to NASA's Science Mission Directorate through contracts or grants, which may diminish a direct incentive for prioritization. Furthermore, his public focus on competing priorities like water infrastructure, agriculture, and border security suggests that increased discretionary spending on space science may not align with his immediate legislative agenda.</p>
<p>However, his critical position on the House Committee on Appropriations offers a direct avenue for influence on NASA's budget, and his support for recent appropriations bills indicates engagement with federal funding processes. The growing research ecosystem at Fresno State University within his district, which actively seeks NASA funding, provides a local connection that could be highlighted as a future economic and scientific opportunity. While he has not explicitly advocated for <em>increased</em> science funding, his co-sponsorship of the NASA Reauthorization Act of 2024 suggests a foundational understanding and support for NASA's overall mission that advocates can build upon.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Explore how NASA's Earth science data and research, particularly in areas like water resource management, drought monitoring, or agricultural efficiency, could directly benefit the Central Valley's farming community and align with Representative Valadao's focus on water infrastructure.</li>
<li>Look into specific research programs or faculty at Fresno State University that either currently engage with NASA or could significantly benefit from increased NASA science funding, demonstrating local educational and economic opportunities within his district.</li>
<li>Consider how to articulate the long-term economic returns, technological innovation, and national competitiveness benefits of NASA science investments, framing them as a fiscally prudent use of federal funds for Representative Valadao's role on the House Appropriations Committee.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About David G. Valadao</h2>
<ul>
<li>Dairy farmer and business owner for Valadao Dairy.</li>
<li>Served one term in the California State Assembly (2010-2012).</li>
<li>Attended College of the Sequoias; did not complete a degree.</li>
<li>No public record found of military service or direct STEM/space background.</li>
<li>Fluent in Portuguese and Spanish.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key Committee Assignment:</strong> Representative Valadao's membership on the House Committee on Appropriations provides him direct influence over federal spending decisions, including NASA's budget for science activities. (House.gov, Current)</li>
<li><strong>Support for Federal Funding:</strong> He voted in favor of the Fiscal Year 2024 Consolidated Appropriations Act and a Fiscal Year 2026 Continuing Resolution, demonstrating a commitment to the federal budgeting process that includes funding for government agencies like NASA. (U.S. Congressman David Valadao Press Release, 2024-03; U.S. Congressman David Valadao Press Release, 2025-09)</li>
<li><strong>Local Research Ecosystem:</strong> Fresno State University, located within his district, actively lists NASA as a potential funding source for research and has demonstrated significant growth in overall research funding in recent years, indicating a strong local capacity for scientific endeavors. (Fresno State, Current; Fresno State News, 2023-09; Fresno State News, 2024-09)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism and Spending Reduction Focus:</strong> Representative Valadao consistently emphasizes balancing the budget and reducing federal spending, including supporting the FY24 Consolidated Appropriations Act which secured "significant cuts to Biden's inflationary spending," indicating a general posture that may limit support for increased discretionary spending on NASA science. (House.gov, 2024-03)</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Direct Local NASA Economic Ties:</strong> No relevant NASA Science Mission Directorate contracts or grants have been identified within California's 22nd district, suggesting a potential absence of direct economic incentive for the Representative to prioritize increased NASA science funding. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Strong Focus on Competing Priorities:</strong> Representative Valadao's public statements and legislative actions frequently highlight priorities such as water infrastructure, agriculture, border security, and national defense, which may compete for attention and resources against increased NASA science investments. (House.gov, 2024)</li>
<li><strong>Stance on Environmental Regulation:</strong> While committed to environmental protection, his energy policy advocates for an "all of the above" approach including oil and natural gas exploration and reducing "red tape," and he has voted against certain EPA rules, which could indicate less enthusiasm for specific aspects of NASA's Earth science activities. (House.gov, undated)</li>
<li><strong>No Explicit Public Advocacy for Increased NASA Science Investment:</strong> Despite his role on the House Committee on Appropriations and co-sponsorship of the NASA Reauthorization Act of 2024, there is no recent public record of Representative Valadao explicitly advocating for <em>increased</em> funding or <em>growth</em> in NASA's Science Mission Directorate activities. (Congress.gov, 2024-09)</li>
