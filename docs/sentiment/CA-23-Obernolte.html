<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Jay Obernolte's strong fiscal conservatism and consistent calls for reduced federal spending present a significant challenge to advocating for increased NASA space science funding, particularly in light of proposed cuts. While he champions technological advancement, his focus on AI and applied technology, coupled with a lens of national security and economic competitiveness for science funding, suggests he may prioritize certain scientific endeavors over broader fundamental research or Earth science initiatives he perceives as regulatory. His willingness to scrutinize what he deems "wasteful spending" means any request for increased investment will face rigorous review.</p>
<p>Despite these fiscal concerns, Representative Obernolte's engineering background from Caltech and direct role on the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee indicate a foundational understanding and oversight of NASA's mission. Crucially, his district benefits from substantial NASA science investments, including over $7 million in contracts for Earth science GIS software and $3.6 million in grants for space biology research, providing concrete examples of how NASA science directly impacts his constituents. Advocates can leverage these local ties and his appreciation for technological innovation to frame increased science investment as a strategic imperative for national leadership and local economic benefit.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider highlighting how NASA's science investments directly benefit his district through local institutions like ESRI and Loma Linda University, emphasizing the advanced technological applications and engineering challenges these projects address.</li>
<li>Explore specific examples of how NASA science, beyond fundamental discovery, yields tangible returns on investment through technological spin-offs, job creation, or contributions to national security and economic competitiveness, addressing his fiscal concerns.</li>
<li>Look into how increased support for NASA's science mission directorates can further integrate and advance artificial intelligence and other cutting-edge technologies, aligning with his bipartisan leadership in AI and innovation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Jay Obernolte</h2>
<ul>
<li>Graduated Caltech with a BS in engineering and applied science.</li>
<li>Holds an MS in artificial intelligence from UCLA.</li>
<li>Founded and leads FarSight Studios, a video game development company.</li>
<li>Holds an airline transport pilot's license and is a certified flight instructor.</li>
<li>Co-chairs a bipartisan taskforce on artificial intelligence.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Technical Expertise and AI Leadership:</strong> Representative Obernolte's background, including a BS in engineering from Caltech and an MS in AI from UCLA, combined with his role as co-chair of the Bipartisan House Task Force on Artificial Intelligence, demonstrates a strong foundation in and commitment to advanced scientific and technological innovation, which is crucial for NASA's science missions. The AI Task Force report notes AI's application in NASA for fire monitoring. (Biography, Speaker.gov, 2024-12)</li>
<li><strong>Direct Oversight of NASA:</strong> As a Member of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, Representative Obernolte is directly involved in the legislative process and oversight of NASA's budget and programs, including its science mission directorates, as evidenced by committee hearings on NASA's FY24 and FY25 budget proposals. (Congress.gov, 2023-04, 2024-04)</li>
<li><strong>Local Investment in Earth Science:</strong> NASA has awarded significant contracts totaling over $7 million to Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) in Redlands, CA, located within his district, for geographic information system (GIS) software and services that support NASA's Earth Science Division and Applied Sciences Wildland Fire Program. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2025)</li>
<li><strong>Local Investment in Space Biology:</strong> Loma Linda University in Loma Linda, CA, also within his district, has received NASA grants totaling $3.6 million for research into the effects of the spaceflight environment on human immune cells, directly connecting his constituency to NASA's biological and physical sciences research. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Bipartisan Support for Technology and Innovation:</strong> Representative Obernolte has demonstrated a commitment to fostering technological advancement through bipartisan efforts, such as co-chairing the Bipartisan House Task Force on Artificial Intelligence and co-introducing the Liquid Cooling for AI Act with a Democratic colleague, aligning with the innovative nature of NASA's scientific endeavors. (Speaker.gov, 2024-12; House.gov, 2025-09)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Representative Obernolte consistently advocates for reducing federal spending and balancing the budget, reintroducing bills to combat "wasteful government spending" and voting against large omnibus spending bills, which could lead to scrutiny of NASA's overall budget, including science programs.</li>
<li><strong>Skepticism on Environmental Regulations:</strong> He has expressed criticism of "onerous government intervention in the energy industry" and opposed California's "green agenda" and zero-emission mandates, indicating a potential skepticism towards certain Earth science initiatives perceived as supporting climate change regulations.</li>
<li><strong>Prioritization of AI and Applied Technology:</strong> As Chairman of the Research and Technology Subcommittee, his stated focus on AI research and development and STEM education, while beneficial for technology, might lead to prioritizing these areas over broader fundamental science disciplines within NASA's Science Mission Directorate if budget constraints necessitate choices.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on National Security and Economic Competitiveness for Science Funding:</strong> His legislative efforts to bolster critical mineral supply chains for "homeland security and economic competitiveness" and statements in appropriations reports suggest a framework where science funding may be evaluated primarily through the lens of direct national security or economic return, potentially impacting support for pure scientific discovery.</li>
<li><strong>Opposition to Perceived "Wasteful" Science Spending:</strong> He has publicly supported efforts to identify and cut what he deems "wasteful spending" in scientific research, citing examples from NIH, which indicates a willingness to scrutinize and potentially reduce funding for specific science programs if they do not align with his criteria for fiscal responsibility.</li>
