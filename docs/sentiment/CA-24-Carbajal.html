    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.

<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Carbajal demonstrates a clear appreciation for federal science funding, evidenced by his support for the CHIPS and Science Act and his participation in a town hall expressing concern over research budget cuts, specifically mentioning Europa habitability projects. His district benefits significantly from NASA investment, with UC Santa Barbara receiving millions in grants for Earth science research, including ocean ecosystem studies and lidar development, and local companies securing contracts for advanced space-qualified lidar. This strong local connection to NASA's scientific and technological endeavors, coupled with his general support for science, suggests a foundation for receptiveness.</p>
<p>However, his legislative priorities are broad, and his public record indicates a primary focus on Earth science and local space operations rather than explicit advocacy for other NASA Science Mission Directorate areas like astrophysics or heliophysics. Crucially, his absence from key committees such as House Science, Space, and Technology or Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science limits his direct leverage over NASA science funding. Advocates should emphasize the broader economic and scientific returns of NASA's diverse science portfolio, linking it to his expressed support for federal research and local benefits, particularly in light of proposed budget cuts.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider highlighting specific NASA-funded research projects at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and how increased science investment would directly benefit his former institution and its contributions to Earth science and technology development.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA science investments translate into contracts and job creation for companies in his district, such as Freedom Photonics and Umbra Lab, emphasizing the economic benefits of advanced space technology development.</li>
<li>Look into how broader NASA science initiatives, including planetary science missions like those exploring Europa habitability, align with his stated commitment to federal science funding and "America's legacy of groundbreaking science and technology."</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Salud O. Carbajal</h2>
<ul>
<li>Earned a Bachelor of Arts from UC Santa Barbara and a Master's in organizational management.</li>
<li>Served eight years in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve, including during the Gulf War.</li>
<li>Previously served on the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors for 12 years.</li>
<li>No public record found of specific STEM or space-related professional experience.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advocacy for Federal Science Funding:</strong> Representative Carbajal has actively supported federal investment in science and technology, including voting to increase National Science Foundation funding through the CHIPS and Science Act in 2023 and pledging in November 2024 to fight against its repeal, emphasizing "America's legacy of groundbreaking science and technology." This benefits local institutions like the University of California, Santa Barbara.</li>
<li><strong>Opposition to Research Budget Cuts:</strong> He participated in an August 2025 "Unite for Science and Research" town hall at the University of California, Santa Barbara, expressing concern over federal budget cuts impacting research, including projects related to Europa habitability, and mentioned co-writing legislation to avert such cuts.</li>
<li><strong>Support for Local NASA-Funded Research:</strong> The University of California, Santa Barbara, located in his district and his alma mater, has received multiple NASA grants totaling over $11 million for Earth science activities, including ocean ecosystem studies, lidar development for atmospheric sensing, and contributions to the PACE mission. [cite: USAspending, FY2022-FY2024; biography]</li>
<li><strong>Local Investment in Space Technology:</strong> Companies in his district, such as Freedom Photonics LLC in Santa Barbara and Goleta, have secured NASA contracts for advanced lidar applications, including high-reliability space-qualified lidar sources for water vapor and methane detection, demonstrating local engagement with NASA's scientific instrumentation needs. [cite: USAspending, FY2022-FY2024]</li>
<li><strong>Bipartisan Engagement on Space Issues:</strong> Representative Carbajal co-introduced a bipartisan bill in May 2025 to bolster Spaceport Infrastructure Investments and secured language in the FY2025 National Defense Authorization Act (December 2024) acknowledging space launch noise impacts, indicating a general interest in supporting the broader space enterprise and related research. [cite: U.S. Representative Salud Carbajal Press Release, 2025-05; KEYT, 2024-12]</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competing Priorities Focus:</strong> Representative Carbajal's public record highlights a broad range of legislative priorities, including healthcare, veterans' affairs, economic development, and infrastructure, which could compete for attention and federal funding against increased NASA science investment.</li>
<li><strong>Primary Space Focus on Earth Science and Local Operations:</strong> While he is a strong advocate for environmental protection and his district benefits from NASA contracts primarily in Earth science and space launch operations, there is less explicit public record of him championing other NASA Science Mission Directorate activities (astrophysics, planetary science, heliophysics, biological and physical sciences) or human exploration programs. [cite: 2, 6, 15, 18, 20, 27, USAspending, FY2022-FY2024]</li>
<li><strong>Absence from Key Space-Related Committees:</strong> Representative Carbajal does not hold a current committee assignment on the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee or the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, limiting his direct legislative platform for NASA science funding and policy.</li>
<li><strong>General Fiscal Stance Against Broad Cuts:</strong> His record indicates opposition to broad spending bills that would cut critical social programs, suggesting a general concern for federal program funding, but not necessarily a proactive stance to significantly increase overall federal spending for NASA science.</li>
