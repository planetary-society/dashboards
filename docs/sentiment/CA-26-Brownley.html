    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.
    All AI-generated claims, assessments, and recommendations should be independently verified.

<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, Planetary Science Caucus</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Brownley's legislative record suggests her primary focus lies with veterans' affairs, transportation, healthcare, and environmental protection, which could limit her capacity to prioritize a broad increase across all NASA science activities. Her strong emphasis on climate change and environmental policy indicates she may be more receptive to Earth science applications than to other directorates like astrophysics or heliophysics. This prioritization of other issues presents a challenge for advocating for a significant, across-the-board boost to NASA's Science Mission Directorate.</p>
<p>Despite these competing priorities, there are clear opportunities for engagement. Her membership in the Congressional Planetary Science Caucus and the significant NASA science contracts awarded to Teledyne Scientific &amp; Imaging in her district for missions like the Roman Space Telescope and Lucy demonstrate a direct economic and scientific connection to planetary science and astrophysics. Furthermore, a NASA grant to CSU Channel Islands for STEM diversity in planetary science highlights local educational benefits, providing specific examples of how increased investment directly impacts her constituents and district.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider exploring Representative Brownley's specific interests or past statements as a member of the Congressional Planetary Science Caucus to align your message with her existing commitment to space science, highlighting how local companies like Teledyne Scientific &amp; Imaging contribute to these missions.</li>
<li>Look into the specific impact of the NASA grant at California State University Channel Islands to demonstrate how increased investment in space science directly supports STEM education, diversity, and workforce development within her district.</li>
<li>Explore how increased investment in NASA's space science activities can align with Representative Brownley's broader legislative priorities, such as fostering economic growth, advancing STEM education, or even contributing to a deeper scientific understanding that complements environmental research.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Julia Brownley</h2>
<ul>
<li>Received a bachelor's degree in political science and an MBA.</li>
<li>Worked in marketing and sales prior to public service.</li>
<li>Served on the Santa Monica-Malibu School Board for 12 years.</li>
<li>Authored legislation on environmental issues and alternative proteins.</li>
<li>Served in the California State Assembly before U.S. Congress.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Planetary Science Caucus Membership:</strong> Representative Brownley is a member of the Congressional Planetary Science Caucus in the 119th Congress, an informal group dedicated to advancing federal policies that support space science, research, and exploration.</li>
<li><strong>District's Role in NASA Science Missions:</strong> Her district hosts Teledyne Scientific &amp; Imaging, LLC in Thousand Oaks, CA, which received significant NASA contracts for sensor chip assemblies for the WFIRST (now Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope) and Lucy mission instruments. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Support for STEM Education in Planetary Science:</strong> California State University Channel Islands in Camarillo, CA, within her district, received a NASA grant to increase diversity in STEM by enabling students to shadow NASA planetary scientists. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Engagement with NASA Funding:</strong> Representative Brownley included the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in her FY2024 Community Project Funding requests, indicating active engagement with securing federal funds for the agency.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competing Legislative Priorities:</strong> Representative Brownley's recent legislative activity and stated priorities heavily focus on veterans' affairs, transportation and infrastructure, healthcare, and local community projects, which may limit her capacity to prioritize increased investment across all NASA science activities. (Congresswoman Julia Brownley, 2025-09; Ballotpedia, undated)</li>
<li><strong>Strong Emphasis on Environmental Policy:</strong> Her consistent and recent legislative efforts are strongly directed towards climate change and environmental protection, indicating a potential prioritization of Earth science applications and environmental policy over other NASA science directorates like astrophysics or planetary science. (Congresswoman Julia Brownley, 2025-05; Inside Climate News, 2025-09)</li>
