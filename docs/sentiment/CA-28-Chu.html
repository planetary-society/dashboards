    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.
    All AI-generated claims, assessments, and recommendations should be independently verified.

<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Democratic Co-Chair, Planetary Science Caucus</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Chu is likely to be a highly receptive advocate for increased NASA space science funding, particularly given her recent re-launch and co-chairmanship of the bipartisan Congressional Planetary Science Caucus. She has explicitly voiced alarm at proposed significant cuts to NASA's Science Mission Directorate and the Mars Sample Return mission, committing to push back against such reductions and advocating for the workforce at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in her district.</p>
<p>The substantial NASA Science contracts and grants, totaling billions of dollars to the California Institute of Technology/JPL in her district, provide a significant local economic incentive for her support across all science disciplines. These investments, which she recognizes as critical for the economy, national security, and STEM education, directly align with the goals of increasing NASA's space science budget. While she addresses a broad range of legislative issues, her active leadership and district's direct stake suggest she is likely to be a receptive, though busy, advocate for NASA's space science budget.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider preparing specific examples of how increased NASA science investment directly supports the California Institute of Technology and JPL in her district, reinforcing her strong advocacy for the Mars Sample Return mission and local jobs.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's science missions and the work at JPL contribute to STEM education and workforce development in her district, aligning with her background as an educator and her interest in community development.</li>
<li>Look into sharing personal stories from constituents who work on NASA science projects, particularly those at JPL, to underscore the human impact of these investments and provide her with compelling examples for her role as Planetary Science Caucus Co-Chair.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Judy Chu</h2>
<ul>
<li>Earned a B.A. in mathematics from UCLA in 1974.</li>
<li>Holds a Ph.D. in psychology and taught the subject for 20 years.</li>
<li>Served on local school board, city council (mayor), and state assembly.</li>
<li>First Chinese American woman elected to the U.S. Congress.</li>
<li>Serves as Democratic Co-Chair of the Planetary Science Caucus.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Planetary Science Caucus Co-Chair:</strong> Representative Chu serves as the Democratic Co-Chair of the bipartisan Congressional Planetary Science Caucus, which she helped re-launch in March 2024, demonstrating direct engagement and leadership in advocating for space science, research, and exploration.</li>
<li><strong>Opposes NASA Science Budget Cuts:</strong> As Co-Chair of the Planetary Science Caucus, Representative Chu issued a joint statement in April 2025 expressing alarm at proposed 50% cuts to NASA's Science Mission Directorate and the elimination of funding for the Mars Sample Return mission, committing to push back against these cuts.</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for Mars Sample Return and JPL Workforce:</strong> Representative Chu helped spearhead a letter from California delegates in March 2024 urging the Office of Management and Budget to reverse cuts to the Mars Sample Return mission and lamented layoffs at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), advocating for the return of affected employees.</li>
<li><strong>Recognition of Economic and National Security Benefits:</strong> Representative Chu's official statements and the Planetary Science Caucus charter highlight that investing in planetary science is critical to the economy, national security, and American leadership in science and technology, supporting thousands of jobs nationwide.</li>
<li><strong>Support for STEM Education through Space Initiatives:</strong> The Planetary Science Caucus, co-chaired by Representative Chu, aims to raise awareness of the economic benefits of federal investments in space science, technology development, and STEM education, aligning with NASA JPL's mission in her district to foster STEM education.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competing Legislative Priorities:</strong> Representative Chu's public record indicates a broad focus on issues such as healthcare, immigration reform, education, climate change, and local community development, which may compete for her legislative attention and advocacy efforts alongside space science.</li>
</ul>
