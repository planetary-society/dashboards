    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.

<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, Planetary Science Caucus</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Sherman has demonstrable connections to NASA's science mission, notably through his membership in the Congressional Planetary Science Caucus and his alma mater, UCLA, which is a significant recipient of NASA science grants and contracts for astrophysics, planetary, and Earth science research in his district. His recent vote for the NASA Reauthorization Act and his support for federal research at UCLA, alongside the presence of aerospace companies like Aerojet Rocketdyne and Northrop Grumman contributing to NASA missions, indicate a foundational understanding and appreciation for the agency's work and its local economic impact.</p>
<p>However, his primary focus on foreign affairs and financial services, coupled with his background as a Certified Public Accountant, suggests he will scrutinize budget requests, making advocacy for <em>increased</em> NASA science funding challenging. While he champions federal research, his strong emphasis on Earth-focused environmental science might lead him to prioritize those investments, requiring advocates to clearly articulate the unique value and local benefits of space science, especially in light of proposed budget cuts.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching specific NASA science projects at UCLA that have received funding, preparing to highlight how these investments directly benefit his alma mater, foster innovation, and support high-skill jobs within his district.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA science contracts with companies like Aerojet Rocketdyne and Northrop Grumman in his district contribute to local employment and technological leadership, reinforcing his past support for the aerospace industry and his role in the Planetary Science Caucus.</li>
<li>Look into how NASA's space science activities, while distinct from Earth-focused environmental science, contribute to broader scientific understanding, technological innovation, and economic benefits that align with his general support for federal research and his fiscal scrutiny.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Brad Sherman</h2>
<ul>
<li>Received a B.A. in political science from UCLA and a J.D. from Harvard Law School.</li>
<li>Certified Public Accountant; worked at a Big Four accounting firm.</li>
<li>Served on the California State Board of Equalization from 1991 to 1997.</li>
<li>Instructor at Harvard Law School's International Tax Program.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Planetary Science Caucus Membership:</strong> Representative Sherman is a member of the Congressional Planetary Science Caucus, an informal group dedicated to advancing federal policies that support space science, research, and exploration, including the search for life and planetary defense.</li>
<li><strong>Support for UCLA Federal Research:</strong> Representative Sherman recently (August 2025) opposed efforts to freeze federal research funding at UCLA, emphasizing the importance of such funding for national interests and scientific advancement. His alma mater, UCLA, is a major recipient of NASA science grants for astrophysics, Earth science, and heliophysics research in his district. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for Local Aerospace Industry:</strong> Representative Sherman welcomed the expansion of Aerojet Rocketdyne's facility in his district in August 2021, highlighting its critical role in NASA's Moon and Mars rocket programs and anticipating future NASA contracts. Aerojet Rocketdyne (Canoga Park, CA) and Northrop Grumman (Woodland Hills, CA) in his district receive NASA contracts for components vital to science and exploration missions, including Mars ascent vehicles and the VIPER rover. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Vote for NASA Reauthorization:</strong> Representative Sherman voted in favor of the NASA Reauthorization Act of 2024 (H.R.8958), which passed the House in September 2024, reauthorizing NASA's programs and activities, including space exploration, research, and technology, and establishing requirements for Earth science and monitoring.</li>
<li><strong>General Support for Federal Research:</strong> Representative Sherman championed securing over $20 million in federal funding for U.S.-Israel joint research programs in January 2023, stating that "Every American could benefit from breakthroughs that could come from this research," indicating a broader appreciation for federal investment in scientific and technological innovation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Extensive Committee Focus:</strong> Representative Sherman's prominent roles as a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and Ranking Member on the Financial Services Subcommittee on Capital Markets indicate a primary focus on these areas, potentially diverting attention or prioritization from NASA's space science and exploration activities.</li>
<li><strong>Prioritization of Earth-focused Environmental Science:</strong> Representative Sherman's public statements and legislative efforts consistently emphasize addressing climate change and protecting the environment, including supporting the Inflation Reduction Act and reintroducing the Green New Deal, which may lead to a prioritization of Earth-focused science over space science for new investments.</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal Scrutiny:</strong> Representative Sherman's background as a Certified Public Accountant and his engagement in discussions regarding the federal budget and government funding suggest a likelihood of scrutinizing government expenditures, including NASA's budget requests.</li>
