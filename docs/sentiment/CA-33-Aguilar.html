    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.

<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Appropriations</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Aguilar's position on the House Appropriations Committee presents a significant opportunity to influence NASA's budget, and his district directly benefits from NASA science grants to CSUSB for planetary and Earth science research. His support for local STEM education that includes "space exploration and research," along with his opposition to cuts affecting local scientific endeavors, suggests a general receptiveness to federal investments in science and technology.</p>
<p>However, as Chair of the House Democratic Caucus, his legislative agenda is broad, encompassing numerous competing priorities such as housing, cybersecurity, and AI. While he supports local research, his public statements have not explicitly advocated for a substantial increase in NASA's overall science mission directorate budget, often emphasizing local economic benefits rather than the broader scientific imperative. Advocates will need to clearly connect increased NASA science funding to his existing priorities and local benefits to overcome the skepticism stemming from his broader leadership responsibilities and competing agenda items.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider gathering specific examples and personal stories from researchers or students at the University Enterprises Corporation at CSUSB who are directly involved in the NASA-funded planetary and Earth science projects, demonstrating the tangible local impact of these investments.</li>
<li>Explore how robust investment in NASA's space science activities can directly support his priorities in economic development, advanced technology workforce training, and national security, especially given his role on the Appropriations Committee and his focus on cybersecurity.</li>
<li>Look into how NASA's science missions and discoveries can directly inspire K-12 students in his district, aligning with his Community Project Funding request for space-related STEM exhibits and his past commitment to local educational initiatives as Mayor.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Pete Aguilar</h2>
<ul>
<li>Graduated from the University of Redlands, studying government and business administration.</li>
<li>Served as Mayor of Redlands, California (2010-2014) and on City Council (2006-2014).</li>
<li>Chairs the House Democratic Caucus, becoming the highest-ranking Latino in Congress.</li>
<li>Authored legislation connecting students with the Department of Defense Cyber Scholarship program.</li>
<li>Supported legislation to attract cybersecurity professionals to military service.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Direct Local NASA Science Investments:</strong> Representative Aguilar's district benefits from direct NASA grants to the University Enterprises Corporation at CSUSB for planetary science (Martian cloud watching, MMX mission) and Earth science (Langley Aerosol Research Group Experiment), demonstrating existing federal investment in space science within his constituency. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Appropriations Committee Membership:</strong> As a Member of the House Committee on Appropriations, Representative Aguilar holds a direct position to influence federal spending decisions, including the budget for NASA's science activities. (Pete Aguilar, 2023-05-19)</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for Local Space-Related STEM Education:</strong> Representative Aguilar has submitted a Community Project Funding request for FY2026 that includes developing STEM-related museum exhibits and educational programming for K-12 students, specifically mentioning "space exploration and research." (Pete Aguilar, Community Project Funding, 2025)</li>
<li><strong>Opposition to Cuts Affecting Local Research:</strong> He publicly denounced a government funding bill in March 2025 that cut over $17.5 million in direct federal investments to the Inland Empire, including $1,184,000 for California State University, San Bernardino's (CSUSB) Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Virtual Reality (VR) Research and Retraining Center, which is linked to space exploration and research. (Public Now, 2025-03-17)</li>
<li><strong>Support for Local Advanced Scientific Research:</strong> Representative Aguilar has actively secured federal funding for local entities engaged in advanced technology and research, such as a $300,000 National Science Foundation grant for CSUSB's AI cybersecurity research in May 2025, indicating a general commitment to scientific and technological advancement. (Pete Aguilar, 2025-05-13)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competing Legislative and Funding Priorities:</strong> Representative Aguilar's public statements and community project funding requests indicate a strong focus on affordable housing, economic development, cybersecurity, AI, and general security, which may compete for his legislative focus and advocacy for increased NASA science investment.</li>
<li><strong>Leadership Role and Broad Party Agenda:</strong> As Chair of the House Democratic Caucus, Representative Aguilar holds a significant leadership position that requires him to focus on and advocate for a wide range of party priorities, potentially limiting his capacity to champion specific increases for NASA science funding over other Democratic agenda items.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Explicit Advocacy for NASA Science Growth:</strong> While his district benefits from NASA contracts and grants, his public statements regarding space-related funding tend to highlight local economic benefits and job creation, rather than explicit advocacy for a significant increase in NASA's overall science mission directorate budget or specific science programs.</li>
