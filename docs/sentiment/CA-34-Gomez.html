    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.
    All AI-generated claims, assessments, and recommendations should be independently verified.

<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Gomez's legislative priorities are heavily focused on social and economic issues like healthcare, housing, and immigration, which may overshadow advocacy for increased NASA science funding. His absence from space-related committees also limits his direct influence on NASA's budget and policy. While he has supported NASA broadly, there is no extensive public record of him proactively championing significant growth in NASA's science budget, especially in the face of a proposed 47% cut for FY2026.</p>
<p>However, his district benefits from substantial NASA Science Mission Directorate grants, including nearly $3.5 million to the University of Southern California for space science research and over $1 million to Cal State LA for science programs and STEM education. Additionally, his strong record on climate action and environmental protection aligns well with NASA's Earth Science mission, evidenced by a $1.4 million grant to Los Angeles City Hall for air pollution studies. These local connections and his environmental focus present clear opportunities for advocates to highlight the direct benefits of NASA science investment to his constituents.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider highlighting how NASA's Earth Science mission directly supports his strong commitment to climate action and environmental protection, using the local Los Angeles City Hall grant for air pollution studies as a concrete example of direct benefit to his constituents' health.</li>
<li>Explore specific examples of how NASA science investments, like the grants to USC and Cal State LA for research and STEM pipeline development, create high-tech jobs and educational opportunities within his district, aligning with his public policy background.</li>
<li>Look into how increased investment in NASA science can address broader societal challenges that align with his legislative priorities, such as public health improvements through Earth science data or economic development through technological innovation and skilled workforce training.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Jimmy Gomez</h2>
<ul>
<li>Earned a B.A. in political science and urban planning from UCLA.</li>
<li>Received an M.A. in public policy from Harvard Kennedy School.</li>
<li>Worked as a labor organizer for healthcare and public sector unions.</li>
<li>Served in the California State Assembly from 2012 to 2017.</li>
<li>No public record found of specific STEM or space industry background.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local NASA Science Research:</strong> His district benefits from significant NASA Science Mission Directorate grants, including $2.9 million to the University of Southern California for autonomous surface science in analogue environments and $545,000 for cosmological signals research. Local connection: University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Support for NASA's Broad Science Program and Exploration:</strong> Cal State LA University Auxiliary Services Inc. in his district received a $537,000 grant to execute a balanced science program, focusing on scientific research of the moon, Mars, and beyond, indicating local engagement with NASA's exploration and science initiatives. Local connection: Cal State LA University Auxiliary Services Inc., Los Angeles, CA. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Commitment to Earth Science and Environmental Issues:</strong> Representative Gomez has a strong public record of advocating for climate action and environmental protection, including celebrating the Inflation Reduction Act, which aligns with NASA's Earth Science mission; his district also received a $1.4 million NASA grant for air pollution and health correlation studies. Local connection: Los Angeles City Hall, Los Angeles, CA. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024); (Rep. Jimmy Gomez House.gov, 2022-08)</li>
<li><strong>Investment in STEM Education Linked to Planetary Science:</strong> A $482,000 NASA grant to Cal State LA University Auxiliary Services Inc. in his district aims to diversify student pipelines in STEM through environmental pollution reduction inspired by planetary science, demonstrating a local connection to science education. Local connection: Cal State LA University Auxiliary Services Inc., Los Angeles, CA. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Local Economic Ties to NASA Operations:</strong> Companies in his district, such as Aecom Technical Services, Inc., received over $3.8 million in contracts for architectural and engineering services and construction observation related to NASA standards, indicating a local economic interest in NASA's operational stability. Local connection: Aecom Technical Services, Inc., Los Angeles, CA. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competing Legislative Priorities:</strong> Representative Gomez's public record and campaign platform consistently highlight a broad range of social and economic issues, including healthcare, housing, immigration, and criminal justice reform, which may limit his legislative focus on advocating for increased NASA science and exploration funding.</li>
<li><strong>Absence from Space-Related Committees:</strong> Representative Gomez does not hold any current assignments on space-related committees in the 119th Congress, which could limit his direct legislative influence on NASA's budget and policy. (Authoritative Committee Data)</li>
<li><strong>Limited Proactive Advocacy for NASA Science Growth:</strong> While Representative Gomez voted in favor of the NASA Reauthorization Act of 2024, there is no extensive public record of him explicitly championing significant growth in NASA's science or exploration budgets in his public statements or press releases, especially when compared to his robust advocacy for other legislative priorities.</li>
