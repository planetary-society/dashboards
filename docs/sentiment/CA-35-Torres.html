    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.

<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Appropriations</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Torres's public record suggests a primary focus on immigration and local community needs, indicating that increased NASA science funding may not be her top legislative priority. While she serves on the House Appropriations Committee, her subcommittees do not directly oversee NASA's budget, potentially limiting her direct influence on specific science allocations. Her public statements and legislative activity do not frequently highlight space policy or specific NASA science missions, and the overall NASA science investment in her district, while present, is relatively modest compared to other federal priorities.</p>
<p>However, her position on the full Appropriations Committee provides a critical avenue for influence, especially given the committee's past support for science initiatives. The presence of local entities receiving NASA science contracts and grants, such as Mindrum Precision and Cal Poly Pomona, offers a tangible economic and educational connection to her district. Her engagement in STEM education events also demonstrates an appreciation for inspiring future scientists, providing an opportunity to frame increased NASA science investment as beneficial for local jobs, education, and national leadership.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching the specific local impacts of NASA science contracts and grants in CA-35, such as those with Mindrum Precision or Cal Poly Pomona, to highlight how these investments create jobs and foster innovation within her district.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's science missions inspire students and contribute to STEM education in her district, building on her past "Reach for the Stars" event and her interest in community development.</li>
<li>Look into how NASA's Earth science activities, such as those related to climate monitoring or disaster preparedness, align with her focus on humanitarian aid and community resilience, potentially linking to her past as a 9-1-1 dispatcher.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Norma J. Torres</h2>
<ul>
<li>Worked as a 9-1-1 dispatcher, leading a campaign for bilingual operators.</li>
<li>Served on the Pomona City Council and as Mayor of Pomona.</li>
<li>Elected to both the California State Assembly and State Senate.</li>
<li>Earned a bachelor's degree in labor studies from National Labor College.</li>
<li>Became a U.S. citizen in 1992 after immigrating from Guatemala.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Appropriations Committee Influence:</strong> Representative Torres's membership on the House Committee on Appropriations provides a direct avenue to influence NASA's budget, including science programs, as evidenced by the committee's detailed reports on NASA funding for FY2024, FY2025, and FY2026.</li>
<li><strong>Direct Local NASA Science Investment:</strong> Multiple entities within her district (CA-35) receive NASA contracts and grants for science-related activities, such as Mindrum Precision Inc. for Dragonfly mission components and Ocean Motion Technologies Inc. for integrating NASA Earth observations for marine conservation. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Committee Support for Science Missions:</strong> The House Appropriations Committee, on which Representative Torres serves, has demonstrated specific support for science initiatives, such as fully funding Mars Sample Return in the FY2024 House bill and providing a $300 million lifeline for it in the FY2026 bill, rejecting proposed terminations.</li>
<li><strong>STEM Education and Inspiration:</strong> Representative Torres hosted a "Reach for the Stars" virtual event with NASA astronauts for Inland Empire students, highlighting the importance of STEM and inspiring future scientists and engineers within her district.</li>
<li><strong>Proactive Federal Funding for District:</strong> Her consistent use of Community Project Funding requests to secure federal resources for her district, including for local infrastructure and economic development, indicates a proactive approach to bringing federal investment home, which could extend to local space science initiatives.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competing Priorities Focus:</strong> Representative Torres's public record consistently highlights a strong focus on immigration, particularly concerning Central America, and local community needs, as evidenced by numerous press releases and legislative efforts. For example, she urged the Biden Administration to prioritize humanitarian aid to Central America in September 2023.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Public Engagement on Space Policy:</strong> A review of Representative Torres's official press releases and public statements from 2023-2024 does not frequently feature proactive advocacy for increased NASA science funding or specific science and exploration missions, indicating these may not be a primary focus of her public communication efforts.</li>
<li><strong>Absence of Specific Space-Related Legislation:</strong> No public record indicates Representative Torres has recently introduced or co-sponsored standalone legislation specifically aimed at expanding NASA's Science Mission Directorate activities or exploration programs.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Direct Oversight on NASA Funding:</strong> As a member of the House Committee on Appropriations, Representative Torres serves on the Subcommittees on Financial Services and General Government and Homeland Security, but not the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (CJS) Subcommittee, which directly oversees NASA's budget. This limits her direct influence over specific NASA funding allocations.</li>
