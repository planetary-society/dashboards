<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, Planetary Science Caucus</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Lieu's strong ties to the aerospace industry, evidenced by his co-chairmanship of the California Aerospace Caucus and his district's significant NASA science contracts, including for the James Webb Space Telescope, suggest a foundational receptiveness to space investment. His membership in the Congressional Planetary Science Caucus and co-introduction of the Space Infrastructure Act further indicate an understanding of and support for space-related endeavors, including scientific missions.</p>
<p>However, his prominent focus on Artificial Intelligence and broader social priorities as Vice Chair of the Democratic Caucus could present competing demands for his attention and federal funding. While he advocates for environmental protection, his emphasis might lean towards terrestrial applications, potentially narrowing his support for the full breadth of NASA's science portfolio. Advocates should highlight how increased NASA science funding directly benefits his district's aerospace sector and aligns with his interest in technological advancement and critical infrastructure.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider preparing specific examples of how NASA science investments directly benefit his district through projects at Northrop Grumman, The Aerospace Corporation, and UCLA, linking these to his public support for JWST and his role in the Planetary Science Caucus.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's cutting-edge science, including Earth observation for climate monitoring and AI applications in data analysis, directly aligns with his strong advocacy for environmental protection and responsible AI development.</li>
<li>Look into how NASA's foundational science research underpins the critical space infrastructure he championed, and how continued investment supports the technological advancements and skilled workforce that align with his computer science background and aerospace expertise.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Ted Lieu</h2>
<ul>
<li>Graduated Stanford University with a B.S. in Computer Science.</li>
<li>Served on active duty and in the Air Force Reserve, achieving Colonel rank.</li>
<li>Chaired the California Assembly Select Committee on Aerospace.</li>
<li>Authored state laws on environmental protection and public safety.</li>
<li>Advocated for Artificial Intelligence regulation and mitigating AI risks.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Planetary Science Caucus Membership:</strong> Representative Lieu is a member of the Congressional Planetary Science Caucus, an informal group dedicated to advancing federal policies that support space science, research, and exploration, including the search for life beyond Earth. This aligns with local research, such as UCLA's Planetary Plasma Interactions node, which archives data from NASA-sponsored charged particle and electromagnetic field instruments. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Support for James Webb Space Telescope:</strong> Representative Lieu publicly praised the first images from NASA's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in July 2022, highlighting his district's role in its development and calling it a "meteoric new era of space exploration." Northrop Grumman in Redondo Beach, located in his district, was the prime contractor for JWST. (Congressman Ted Lieu, 2022-07) (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Co-Chair of California Aerospace Caucus:</strong> As Co-Chair of the California Aerospace Caucus, Representative Lieu has consistently advocated for U.S. leadership in space research and exploration, emphasizing the aerospace community's vital role in scientific and technological advancement. His district is home to significant aerospace facilities and companies like The Aerospace Corporation and Raytheon Company. (Congressman Ted Lieu, 2025-05) (Congressman Ted Lieu, 2024-04) (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Bipartisan Space Infrastructure Act:</strong> Representative Lieu co-introduced the bipartisan Space Infrastructure Act in July 2023, which seeks to designate space systems, services, and technology as a critical infrastructure sector. This initiative underscores the importance of protecting space assets, which are foundational for many scientific and exploration missions. (Congressman Ted Lieu, 2023-07)</li>
<li><strong>Aerospace Background and Expertise:</strong> Representative Lieu's background includes chairing the California Assembly Select Committee on Aerospace and a B.S. in Computer Science from Stanford University, indicating a foundational interest and understanding of the aerospace and technology sectors relevant to NASA's science activities. (Biography)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competing Priorities - Artificial Intelligence:</strong> Representative Lieu's significant leadership and focus on Artificial Intelligence, including co-chairing the House's Bipartisan Taskforce on AI in the 118th Congress, may divert his legislative attention from broader NASA science initiatives. (Congressman Ted Lieu, 2024-02; Digital Dialogue Forum, 2024)</li>
<li><strong>Specific Environmental Focus:</strong> While strongly advocating for environmental protection and climate change action, as evidenced by his reintroduction of the "Climate Solutions Act" in September 2023, his focus might be more narrowly on terrestrial applications of Earth science rather than the full breadth of NASA's science portfolio. (Congressman Ted Lieu, 2023-09)</li>
<li><strong>Broader Social Priorities:</strong> As Vice Chair of the Democratic Caucus, Representative Lieu has highlighted affordable healthcare as a top priority for House Democratic leaders in September 2025, indicating a focus on social programs that could compete for federal discretionary spending. (The Epoch Times, 2025-09)</li>
