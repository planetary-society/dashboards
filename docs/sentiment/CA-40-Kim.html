    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.

<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Kim's receptiveness to increased NASA space science funding is mixed. While she has a strong record of advocating for STEM education and recently co-signed a bipartisan letter opposing cuts to the Mars Sample Return mission, citing "lost science," her current lack of space-related committee assignments and broader fiscal conservative priorities may present challenges. Advocates should anticipate her scrutiny of government expenditures, particularly given the proposed 47% cut in FY 2026.</p>
<p>However, the presence of significant NASA science grants to Chapman University within her district, spanning Earth science and surface biology, offers a clear local connection. Highlighting these direct district benefits, alongside the economic and scientific value of missions she has previously supported, could resonate. Framing increased investment as critical for innovation and local economic impact, rather than solely as an expenditure, will be key to garnering her support.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider highlighting how NASA's space science investments directly translate into local job creation, economic activity, and STEM workforce development within the 40th district, referencing specific grants to Chapman University and contracts with Suss Microtec Inc.</li>
<li>Explore how the long-term scientific returns and technological spin-offs from NASA's space science missions, similar to the Mars Sample Return mission she supported, contribute to American innovation and global leadership, aligning with her past engagement in space policy.</li>
<li>Look into framing increased investment in NASA's space science as a fiscally responsible strategic investment that yields significant returns in technological advancement, international collaboration, and national prestige, rather than "reckless spending."</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>STEM Education Advocacy:</strong> Representative Kim has consistently advocated for increased education funding in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM), co-leading a bipartisan resolution in April 2025 to recognize Mathematics and Statistics Awareness Month and emphasizing STEM's role in innovation and economic growth. This aligns with NASA's efforts to develop the future science workforce. (Rep. Young Kim Press Release, 2025-04)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support for Mars Sample Return Mission:</strong> In November 2023, Representative Kim co-signed a bipartisan letter opposing NASA's proposed funding cuts to the Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission, citing concerns about job losses and "a decade of lost science." This demonstrates direct support for a significant planetary science program. (The San Fernando Valley Sun, 2023-11)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Local NASA Science Grants:</strong> Chapman University in Orange, CA, within Representative Kim's district, received multiple NASA grants between FY2022 and FY2024 for projects directly related to NASA's Science Mission Directorate, including Earth science (water management, ecostress, sea surface salinity) and surface biology and geology. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Local NASA Technology Contracts:</strong> Suss Microtec Inc. in Corona, CA, also within CA-40, received NASA contracts between FY2022 and FY2024 for high-tech equipment, including a UV light source upgrade for NASA Glenn Research Center, indicating local industry engagement with NASA's technological infrastructure that supports scientific endeavors. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Past Space Policy Engagement:</strong> Representative Kim previously served on the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee's Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee during the 117th Congress, demonstrating a historical interest and direct engagement with space policy and NASA's research and exploration missions. (Rep. Young Kim Press Release, 2021-02)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Lack of Space-Related Committee Assignment:</strong> Representative Kim does not hold any current space-related committee assignments in the 119th Congress, which may limit her direct engagement with NASA's space science and exploration portfolio. (Authoritative Committee Data)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fiscal Conservatism and Spending Scrutiny:</strong> Representative Kim has consistently emphasized combating "reckless spending" and lowering taxes as legislative priorities, indicating a general fiscal conservative posture that could lead to scrutiny of government expenditures, including NASA's budget. (Los Angeles Times, 2024-02-01; Congresswoman Young Kim, 2022-10-20; Congresswoman Young Kim, 2025-02-26)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Competing Legislative Priorities:</strong> Her primary legislative focus is on foreign affairs, financial services, combating inflation, and border security, as evidenced by her committee assignments (House Foreign Affairs, House Financial Services) and public statements, potentially diverting attention from space science initiatives. (Fullerton Observer, 2025-01-12; ABA Banking Journal, 2025-01-08; POLITICO Pro, 2025-08-27)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Skepticism Towards Environmental Funding:</strong> Representative Kim's voting record reflects a low pro-environment score (18% in 2024, 14% in 2023) from the League of Conservation Voters, which may indicate a predisposition to question or limit funding for Earth science activities, particularly those related to climate change. (League of Conservation Voters, 2024, 2023)</p>
