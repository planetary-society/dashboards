<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Appropriations</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Calvert's strong fiscal conservatism and his role as Chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense suggest a primary focus on defense spending and a reluctance to significantly increase non-defense budgets, including NASA's science programs. His past skepticism regarding climate change may also make advocacy for NASA's Earth science activities particularly challenging, and the limited direct economic ties to NASA science within his district offer little immediate leverage.</p>
<p>However, his historical leadership as former Chair of the House Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee and author of the NASA Authorization Act of 2005 demonstrate a foundational commitment to NASA's broader mission. As a current member of the full Appropriations Committee, he holds a key position to influence funding, and his recent bipartisan efforts, such as the Space Infrastructure Act and National Space Day, indicate a continued recognition of the strategic importance of space. These factors, alongside a small local NASA contract, provide a basis for engaging him on the value of space science.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider highlighting Representative Calvert's historical leadership in space, such as his authorship of the 2005 NASA Authorization Act, and connect how robust investment in NASA's science activities underpins the "space infrastructure" he champions for national security and economic benefit.</li>
<li>Explore how increased investment in NASA's science mission can create new opportunities for local businesses, foster STEM education, and contribute to the district's economic vitality, even in the absence of large direct science contracts.</li>
<li>Look into specific NASA science missions or discoveries that align with Representative Calvert's broader interests, such as national security applications, technological innovation, or data relevant to local infrastructure priorities like water management.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Ken Calvert</h2>
<ul>
<li>Graduated from San Diego State University with a Bachelor of Arts degree.</li>
<li>Previously a small business owner in the restaurant and real estate industries.</li>
<li>Chaired the House Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee in the 109th Congress.</li>
<li>Authored the NASA Authorization Act of 2005, supporting space science and aeronautics.</li>
<li>Original author of the E-Verify law for employment verification.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Historical Space Leadership:</strong> Representative Calvert's past chairmanship of the House Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee and authorship of the NASA Authorization Act of 2005 demonstrate a foundational commitment to NASA's mission, including space science and aeronautics. (Wikipedia, 2025-09; House.gov, 2025-09)</li>
<li><strong>Appropriations Committee Influence:</strong> As a current member of the House Committee on Appropriations, Representative Calvert holds a key position to influence federal funding decisions, including potential allocations for NASA's Science Mission Directorate. (House.gov, 2025-09)</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for Space as Critical Infrastructure:</strong> In February 2025, Representative Calvert introduced the bipartisan Space Infrastructure Act (H.R. 1154), emphasizing the vital role of space systems for national security and the economy, which broadly supports investment in space capabilities. (ExecutiveGov, 2025-02; Calvert.House.gov, 2025-02)</li>
<li><strong>Promotion of National Space Day:</strong> Co-reintroducing a resolution in May 2025 to establish National Space Day, alongside Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA), highlights his recognition of the aerospace community's contributions to scientific and economic development and the importance of continued space exploration. (Lieu.House.gov, 2025-05)</li>
<li><strong>Local NASA Contract:</strong> A NASA contract awarded to Battery Backup Power Inc. in Corona, CA, within his district, indicates a direct local economic connection to NASA's activities. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Representative Calvert has consistently advocated for reducing government spending and opposed significant increases in federal funding, including voting against the Inflation Reduction Act, which could limit support for growing NASA's science budget.</li>
<li><strong>Defense Spending Priority:</strong> As Chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, Representative Calvert prioritizes national defense and has explicitly rejected parity between defense and non-defense funding, potentially diverting resources or attention from civilian space science.</li>
<li><strong>Skepticism on Climate/Earth Science:</strong> Representative Calvert has a public record of voting against climate change and environmental protection legislation and has expressed skepticism about climate change, which may indicate limited support for NASA's Earth science activities.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Local NASA Science Economic Ties:</strong> The public record shows only a very small, general contract for a local company, indicating limited direct economic ties within his district specifically to NASA's science mission directorate activities. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Competing Local Infrastructure Priorities:</strong> Representative Calvert has recently focused on advocating for specific local infrastructure projects, such as water management and flood control, which may compete for his attention and legislative efforts.</li>
