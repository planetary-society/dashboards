<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Appropriations</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Levin's recent appointment to the House Appropriations Committee provides a significant opportunity for direct influence over NASA's budget, and his consistent support for federal science funding, including the CHIPS and Science Act, indicates a generally receptive stance. His strong background in environmental law and advocacy for climate change solutions align particularly well with NASA's Earth Science activities, as evidenced by his efforts to fund climate scientists and his district's grant for Earth magnetosphere research. Furthermore, his emphasis on Congress's "power of the purse" suggests a willingness to defend congressionally approved budgets against executive branch cuts.</p>
<p>However, advocates should be aware that his primary focus on climate and environmental issues may lead him to prioritize terrestrial solutions or NASA's Earth Science over other science directorates if budget choices become necessary, especially given the proposed FY26 cuts. While his district benefits from some NASA contracts, these are relatively modest and primarily manufacturing-focused, offering less direct economic incentive for broad NASA science advocacy. Explicit advocacy for astrophysics, planetary science, heliophysics, or biological and physical sciences has been less prominent in his public statements, suggesting advocates will need to clearly articulate the value and local connections of these diverse scientific pursuits.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider how NASA's broader science portfolio, beyond Earth science, contributes to foundational scientific knowledge and technological innovation that can indirectly inform climate solutions or inspire future environmental scientists and engineers in his district.</li>
<li>Explore how the existing NASA contracts and grants in his district, particularly the Solana Scientific grant, demonstrate the local economic and scientific benefits of diverse federal investments in space science, reinforcing his role on the Appropriations Committee.</li>
<li>Look into specific examples of how investments in astrophysics, planetary science, or heliophysics align with his stated support for federal research funding and the CHIPS and Science Act, framing a robust NASA science budget as an investment in national innovation and scientific leadership.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Mike Levin</h2>
<ul>
<li>Earned a J.D. from Duke University School of Law, specializing in environmental law.</li>
<li>Co-founded CleanTech OC, a trade group promoting sustainable energy.</li>
<li>Worked with cleantech companies on methane capture and fuel cell energy.</li>
<li>Prioritizes addressing climate change, supporting major climate legislation.</li>
<li>Supported infrastructure investments for climate resilience and broadband expansion.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Appropriations Committee Member:</strong> Representative Levin's appointment to the House Committee on Appropriations on January 7, 2025, provides him with direct influence over federal spending, including NASA's budget, and he has stated his intent to "fight for resources and advocate for investments".</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for Science and Research Funding:</strong> He has consistently supported federal investments in biomedical and climate research, and helped secure funding for the National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation, indicating a general pro-science funding posture. He also supported the CHIPS and Science Act to boost innovation.</li>
<li><strong>Strong Climate Change and Earth Science Focus:</strong> As an environmental attorney and advocate, Representative Levin prioritizes addressing climate change, which aligns with NASA's Earth Science activities, and he has fought for funding for climate scientists at local institutions like Scripps Institution of Oceanography. He also led a letter urging the EPA to maintain policies combating climate pollution on September 17, 2025.</li>
<li><strong>Local NASA Science and Technology Investments:</strong> His district benefits from NASA contracts and grants, including a grant to Solana Scientific, Inc. for research on "Pressure pulse interactions with the Earth'S magnetosphere," demonstrating a direct local connection to NASA science and technology development [cite: USAspending, FY2022-FY2024].</li>
<li><strong>Defense of Congressional "Power of the Purse":</strong> Representative Levin has recently (September 4, 2025, and August 14, 2025) emphasized Congress's constitutional authority over federal spending and criticized executive branch attempts to cut or redirect appropriated funds, indicating a willingness to defend congressionally approved budgets for scientific research.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Strong Climate/Environmental Focus:</strong> Representative Levin's consistent public record emphasizes climate change, clean energy, and environmental protection, which, while supportive of NASA Earth science, may lead to a prioritization of terrestrial climate solutions over other NASA science directorates or exploration programs if budget choices are necessary. (U.S. Congressman Mike Levin, 2025-09; U.S. Congressman Mike Levin, 2025-01; U.S. Congressman Mike Levin, 2024-01)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Limited Direct Economic Incentive for Broad NASA Science:</strong> The NASA contracts and grants within the 49th district are relatively modest in total value and primarily involve manufacturing components or a specific Earth magnetosphere research grant, suggesting less direct economic impetus for broad NASA science and exploration advocacy compared to districts with major NASA facilities. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>General Budgetary Scrutiny and Competing Priorities on Appropriations:</strong> As a member of the House Committee on Appropriations, Representative Levin has voiced concerns about congressional power over spending and has highlighted other pressing district and national challenges like nuclear waste removal, sand replenishment, and veterans' health, which could compete for federal resources. (U.S. Congressman Mike Levin, 2025-01; U.S. Congressman Mike Levin, 2024-09; Forbes Breaking News, 2025-07)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lack of Explicit Advocacy for Non-Earth Science/Exploration:</strong> While co-sponsoring the NASA Reauthorization Act of 2024, which includes exploration and various science areas, Representative Levin's recent individual public statements and press releases within the last 24 months do not feature explicit, strong advocacy for specific astrophysics, planetary science (beyond the reauthorization bill), heliophysics, or biological and physical sciences missions or increased funding. (Congress.gov, 2024-09)</p>
