    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.
    All AI-generated claims, assessments, and recommendations should be independently verified.
    This is an experimental feature, and intended to provide guidance and inspiration for outreach strategies for your meeting. Feedback is welcome: casey.dreier@planetary.org.

<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Jacobs lacks direct influence on space policy due to no space-related committee assignments and consistently prioritizes other legislative areas like child care, reproductive rights, and international affairs. Her public record does not show proactive advocacy for increasing NASA's overall space science budget, and her past voting record on significant science legislation has shown an ambiguous stance, suggesting space science may not be a top-tier focus.</p>
<p>However, there are strong local connections and a general appreciation for science investment. Her district benefits from substantial NASA Science Mission Directorate contracts and grants totaling $24.8 million over the last three fiscal years, directly supporting astrophysics, planetary science, heliophysics, and Earth science activities. Furthermore, Representative Jacobs has demonstrated support for federal science and technology investment, championed local STEM workforce development through community project funding, and advocated for broader STEM education, providing a solid basis for engagement on the economic and educational benefits of increased NASA science funding.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Explore how NASA's space science activities, particularly those with local contract recipients like San Diego State University Foundation and Predictive Science Incorporated, directly contribute to the STEM workforce development and educational initiatives Representative Jacobs champions in her district.</li>
<li>Consider researching the specific local companies and institutions in CA-51, such as Atk Space Systems and Malin Space Science Systems, that receive NASA Science contracts, and be prepared to articulate how these investments foster high-tech job creation and economic growth in her district.</li>
<li>Look into how NASA's space science activities align with broader federal science and technology investment goals, like those in the CHIPS and Science Act, and consider framing the global impact and international collaboration aspects of space science, which may resonate with her international relations background.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Sara Jacobs</h2>
<ul>
<li>Holds a Master's degree in International Relations from Columbia University.</li>
<li>Worked for the United Nations, UNICEF, and U.S. Department of State.</li>
<li>Grandfather co-founded Qualcomm, a major semiconductor company.</li>
<li>Authored legislation on personal reproductive health data privacy.</li>
<li>Founded a nonprofit focused on ending child poverty in San Diego.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Support for Federal Science and Technology Investment:</strong> Representative Jacobs voted "Yes" on the CHIPS and Science Act in August 2022, which authorized significant federal funding for science agency programs and semiconductor production, aligning with a general appreciation for federal investment in scientific and technological advancement. Her district has a strong tech sector, and her family background includes co-founding Qualcomm, a major semiconductor company. (Ballotpedia, 2022-08)</li>
<li><strong>Championing Local STEM Workforce Development:</strong> Representative Jacobs submitted Community Project Funding requests for FY 2026, including an "AI-Enabled Robotics Training Center" and programs for "hands-on training and workforce development for students to enter the STEM industry" at the San Diego State University Research Foundation. These initiatives directly support the development of a skilled workforce in science and technology fields within her district. (U.S. Congresswoman Sara Jacobs Official Website, 2025)</li>
<li><strong>Advocating for Education Funding Including STEM:</strong> In July 2025, Representative Jacobs co-led the entire California Democratic Delegation in demanding the immediate release of federal education funding, explicitly listing "STEM education" as one of the vital investments. This demonstrates a commitment to ensuring resources for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education. (U.S. Congresswoman Sara Jacobs Official Website, 2025)</li>
<li><strong>Direct Local Economic Impact from NASA Science Contracts:</strong> Her district, CA-51, is home to companies and institutions receiving substantial NASA Science Mission Directorate contracts and grants, including for astrophysics (Atk Space Systems LLC), planetary science (Malin Space Science Systems, Inc.), heliophysics (Predictive Science Incorporated), and Earth science (San Diego State University Foundation). These contracts represent direct local investment in NASA's scientific endeavors. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>General Support for Federal Investment in Local Projects:</strong> Representative Jacobs has consistently secured federal funding for her district, including $13.5 million for 15 local community projects in an appropriations package in March 2024 and $2 million for the San Diego Community College District in May 2024, indicating a proactive stance on bringing federal resources to her constituents, which could extend to science initiatives. (East County Magazine, 2024-03), (U.S. Congresswoman Sara Jacobs Official Website, 2024-05)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>No Space-Related Committee Assignments:</strong> Representative Jacobs holds no current space-related committee assignments in the 119th Congress, limiting her direct influence on space policy and NASA's budget. (Provided Data, 2025-09)</li>
<li><strong>Strong Focus on Competing Priorities:</strong> Representative Jacobs' public legislative priorities consistently emphasize issues such as child care, reproductive rights, international affairs, and social welfare, which may divert her attention from space science advocacy.</li>
<li><strong>Ambiguous Stance on Key Science Legislation:</strong> Representative Jacobs voted "present" on the CHIPS and Science Act in July 2022, a bill that included the first NASA authorization in five years, indicating a potentially ambiguous stance on significant science and space legislation.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Proactive Advocacy for NASA Science Growth:</strong> While supporting general STEM education and innovation through community project funding, Representative Jacobs' public record does not show explicit, proactive advocacy for increasing NASA's overall space science budget or expanding specific exploration programs.</li>
