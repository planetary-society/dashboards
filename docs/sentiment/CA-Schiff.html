<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, Planetary Science Caucus</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Senator Adam Schiff has demonstrated a clear and recent commitment to NASA's science mission, actively opposing proposed budget cuts, including the significant 47% reduction for FY26. His consistent advocacy for critical programs like Mars Sample Return, coupled with his membership in the Planetary Science Caucus and emphasis on protecting California's space workforce—particularly at institutions like JPL, which receives billions in NASA science contracts across all directorates—indicates a strong understanding of and support for these activities. The substantial $8.9 billion in NASA science spending in California over the last three years provides a significant economic incentive for his continued engagement.</p>
<p>While Senator Schiff is likely to be receptive to defending NASA science funding against cuts, advocates should be mindful of his publicly stated "overriding concerns" regarding domestic issues such as housing, homelessness, and healthcare. His broad legislative focus suggests that while he values NASA's contributions, securing substantial <em>increases</em> across all Science Mission Directorate activities may face competition from other pressing priorities on his agenda.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider preparing specific examples of how increased NASA science investment directly supports jobs and economic growth in California, particularly at institutions like JPL, aligning with Senator Schiff's stated concern for the state's workforce.</li>
<li>Explore how current or proposed NASA science missions, beyond Mars Sample Return, contribute to advancements in STEM education, supercomputing, or sustainability efforts, connecting to Senator Schiff's broader understanding of NASA's value.</li>
<li>Look into Senator Schiff's past statements or legislative actions on issues like climate change or technological innovation to identify opportunities to demonstrate how robust NASA science funding can support these broader priorities.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Adam B. Schiff</h2>
<ul>
<li>Graduated from Stanford University and Harvard Law School.</li>
<li>Served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney, prosecuting a Soviet spy.</li>
<li>Authored legislation establishing the Foothill Gold Line Construction Authority.</li>
<li>Served four terms in the California State Senate.</li>
<li>Represented California in the U.S. House of Representatives for 23 years.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Opposition to NASA Science Budget Cuts:</strong> Senator Schiff recently co-signed a letter demanding the administration halt proposed cuts to NASA Science programs, including a 47 percent reduction in the FY26 budget, emphasizing Congress's constitutional authority over funding. This action directly supports program growth by rejecting cuts. (Sen. Adam Schiff Press Release, 2025-08)</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for Mars Sample Return (MSR):</strong> Senator Schiff has consistently opposed cuts to the Mars Sample Return mission, a top planetary science priority, citing its importance for scientific progress and the potential loss of jobs at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California. JPL is a major recipient of NASA contracts for MSR and other planetary science missions. (Sen. Adam Schiff Press Release, 2025-04) (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Membership in Planetary Science Caucus:</strong> Senator Schiff is a member of the Planetary Science Caucus, an informal group dedicated to uniting Members who support space science, research, and exploration, indicating a direct interest in advancing federal policies for planetary science. (Planetary Science Caucus, 119th Congress)</li>
<li><strong>Support for California's Space Workforce:</strong> Senator Schiff has highlighted that proposed NASA budget cuts would result in significant job losses in California, particularly at hubs like JPL, which manages billions in NASA contracts for Earth science, planetary science, heliophysics, and astrophysics. This demonstrates a focus on the economic and workforce benefits of NASA investment. (Sen. Adam Schiff Press Release, 2025-08) (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Recognition of NASA's Broad Impact:</strong> Senator Schiff has stated that NASA's value extends beyond space exploration to include advancements in STEM fields, supercomputing, and sustainability efforts, suggesting a comprehensive understanding of the agency's contributions that could support diverse science activities. (Sierra Sun Times, 2025-04)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competing Domestic Priorities:</strong> Senator Schiff has publicly emphasized economic issues, including housing affordability, homelessness, and healthcare costs, as "overriding concerns" for Californians, which may compete for legislative focus and resources with efforts to significantly expand NASA science funding. (Los Angeles Times, 2024-12-03; Adam Schiff for Senate, undated)</li>
<li><strong>Broad Legislative Focus:</strong> His extensive legislative record and stated priorities encompass a wide array of issues such as climate change, democracy, and social welfare, suggesting a broad agenda that could potentially limit dedicated advocacy for substantial growth in all NASA Science Mission Directorate activities. (Adam Schiff for Senate, undated; Congress.gov, undated)</li>
