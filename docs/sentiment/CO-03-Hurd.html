    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.

<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Hurd's position on the House Science Committee offers a direct avenue for engagement on NASA's Science Mission Directorate. His district benefits from significant NASA science investments, including over $1.5 million in grants to the Aspen Global Change Institute for Earth science research and a nearly $300K grant to the Pinhead Institute for planetary science. Additionally, Colorado Mesa University received $300K to build a diverse STEM network, directly supporting the future workforce for space science endeavors, providing tangible local connections to NASA's scientific mission.</p>
<p>Despite these local ties, advocating for increased NASA science funding, especially against a proposed 47% cut, will likely face scrutiny due to Representative Hurd's emphasis on fiscal conservatism and competing priorities like border security and economic development. His past support for commercial solutions in Earth observations also suggests a preference for market-driven approaches. Advocates should be prepared to clearly articulate the unique "return on investment" of government-led foundational science and its direct benefits to his district, framing NASA science as a critical, non-duplicative investment that supports local jobs and research.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching how the NASA grants to Colorado Mesa University in Grand Junction and contracts with Synergy Systems Corp in Montrose directly contribute to local economic development, job creation, or STEM workforce training within his district.</li>
<li>Explore how the scientific discoveries from local NASA-funded projects, such as the climate change research at Aspen Global Change Institute or planetary science at Pinhead Institute, provide tangible benefits or potential commercial applications that demonstrate a strong return on investment for taxpayers.</li>
<li>Look into specific examples of how NASA's Science Mission Directorate activities, particularly those with local connections, inform national policy decisions or contribute to U.S. leadership in critical scientific fields, appealing to his analytical background and role on the House Science Committee.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Jeff Hurd</h2>
<ul>
<li>Holds a bachelor's degree in philosophy from Notre Dame and a law degree.</li>
<li>Served as a federal judicial law clerk for the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals.</li>
<li>Practiced law, managing a firm's Grand Junction office.</li>
<li>Previously worked for the Grand Junction Area Chamber of Commerce.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>House Science Committee Membership:</strong> Representative Hurd's role as a Member of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology provides direct engagement with NASA's budget and policy, including its Science Mission Directorate activities.</li>
<li><strong>Local Earth Science Investments:</strong> The Aspen Global Change Institute in Basalt, CO, within Representative Hurd's district, received over $1.5 million in NASA grants for interdisciplinary science workshops and research on global and climate change impacts, directly supporting NASA's Earth science goals.</li>
<li><strong>Local Planetary Science Investment:</strong> The Pinhead Institute Inc in Telluride, CO, received a $299K NASA grant to determine Triton's surface composition using New Horizons data, directly contributing to NASA's planetary science objectives.</li>
<li><strong>Local STEM and Research Capacity Building:</strong> Colorado Mesa University in Grand Junction, CO, received a $300K NASA grant to build a diverse STEM network through inter-institutional research collaborations, supporting the pipeline for future space science endeavors.</li>
<li><strong>Local Space Technology Contracts:</strong> Synergy Systems Corp in Montrose, CO, received approximately $80K in NASA contracts for cryopump and compressor upgrades, indicating local involvement in the technological infrastructure supporting space missions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competing Priorities Focus:</strong> Representative Hurd has consistently highlighted border security, rural healthcare access, and economic development as his top priorities, which may compete for legislative attention and funding with NASA science initiatives. (Colorado Politics, 2024-09; Jeff Hurd for Colorado, undated; KKTV, 2024-10).</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism and Spending Scrutiny:</strong> Representative Hurd has supported budget measures with significant federal spending cuts and emphasized fiscal discipline, questioning the "return on investment" for science funding, which could lead to scrutiny of NASA's science budget. (The Sopris Sun, 2025-04; KRDO, 2024-10; OPB, 2025-07).</li>
<li><strong>Preference for Commercial Solutions:</strong> Representative Hurd's sponsorship of the ASCEND Act, which promotes NASA's acquisition of commercial satellite data for Earth observations, indicates a preference for leveraging private sector investments and commercial solutions, potentially influencing his view on the balance between government-led and commercially-driven science initiatives. (Rep. Jeff Hurd, 2025-05; The Durango Herald, 2025-06).</li>
<li><strong>Skepticism of Government Intervention in Energy/Technology:</strong> Representative Hurd has expressed general skepticism regarding government intervention in specific energy technologies and supported the elimination of clean energy tax credits, reflecting a philosophy that could extend to government-funded science programs if perceived as not market-driven or cost-effective. (Colorado Politics, 2024-09; KOTO FM, 2025-05).</li>
