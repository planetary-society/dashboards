<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Boebert's strong fiscal conservatism and consistent advocacy for reducing federal spending present a significant hurdle for increasing NASA space science funding. Her public skepticism regarding climate change also indicates potential resistance to NASA's Earth science programs, a major component of the Science Mission Directorate. While a small business in her district has received a modest NASA contract, the overall direct economic ties to NASA science growth within CO-04 are limited, and her primary legislative priorities lie elsewhere.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, Representative Boebert has consistently advocated for Colorado's broader aerospace industry and U.S. Space Command, demonstrating support for space activities that benefit her state's economy and national security. Her willingness to engage in bipartisan space legislation suggests an openness to certain space-related initiatives. Advocates might find receptiveness by framing NASA science as foundational to future exploration, technology development, and maintaining Colorado's leadership in the broader space sector, rather than focusing solely on specific scientific disciplines that may conflict with her stated priorities.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching the specific local impact of the $70K NASA contract in Byers, CO, and how increased NASA science investment could further support small businesses and job creation within her district, aligning with her advocacy for Colorado's aerospace industry.</li>
<li>Explore examples of NASA space science innovations that have led to practical commercial applications, technological advancements, or economic returns, framing these as fiscally responsible investments rather than "wasteful" spending.</li>
<li>Look into how NASA's space science missions contribute to U.S. technological leadership, national security, and inspire STEM education, emphasizing these non-partisan benefits that align with her willingness to engage in bipartisan space legislation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Lauren Boebert</h2>
<ul>
<li>Earned a GED certificate in 2020, prior to her first election to Congress.</li>
<li>Professional experience includes McDonald's, natural gas industry, and restaurant ownership.</li>
<li>Owned and operated Shooters Grill, a restaurant in Rifle, Colorado.</li>
<li>Her husband worked as a consultant in the natural gas drilling industry.</li>
<li>No public record found of military service or direct space/STEM professional background.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advocacy for Colorado's Space Industry:</strong> Representative Boebert has consistently advocated for maintaining U.S. Space Command in Colorado, citing the state's significant aerospace economy and jobs, and has secured federal resources for NASA's Space Launch System, Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle, and Exploration Ground Systems. Colorado is home to the nation's second-largest aerospace economy, supporting over 232,000 jobs, with Pueblo (within her former district, now in CO-04) noted as benefiting from Space Command jobs.</li>
<li><strong>Bipartisan Space Legislation:</strong> Representative Boebert co-introduced the Space National Guard Establishment Act with Congressman Jason Crow (D-CO-06) in March 2025, demonstrating a willingness to engage in bipartisan efforts to strengthen U.S. space capabilities. This legislation aims to bolster Colorado's aerospace industry and maintain military preparedness within the state.</li>
<li><strong>Local NASA Contract Presence:</strong> A small business in Byers, CO (within her district), Luna Corp LLC, received a $70K NASA contract for support services, indicating direct economic benefit from NASA activities in her constituency.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Representative Boebert consistently advocates for reducing federal spending, balancing the budget, and eliminating "waste, fraud, and abuse" across government agencies, often voting against large appropriations bills. (House.gov, 2024; The Independent, 2024; Colorado Politics, 2024)</li>
<li><strong>Opposition to Earth Science Funding:</strong> Representative Boebert has publicly expressed skepticism about anthropogenic climate change and criticized "Green New Deal" policies, indicating potential resistance to NASA's Earth science programs. (Newsweek, 2023; House.gov, 2025; Colorado Public Radio, 2024)</li>
<li><strong>Competing Priorities Focus:</strong> Her stated legislative priorities and successful initiatives primarily center on issues such as border security, domestic energy production, water infrastructure, and forest management, rather than space science or exploration. (House.gov, 2024; Colorado Public Radio, 2024; KUNC, 2025)</li>
<li><strong>Skepticism of Federal Bureaucracy:</strong> Representative Boebert has advocated for reining in federal agencies, cutting "unnecessary programs," and exercising strict oversight to eliminate perceived waste, which could extend to federal science initiatives. (House.gov, 2024; CraigDailyPress.com, 2023)</li>
<li><strong>Limited Direct Local Economic Ties to NASA Science Growth:</strong> The NASA contracts identified within CO-04 are relatively modest in total value and primarily involve programmatic environmental assessment, support services, or smaller-scale technology development, which may not translate into a strong local economic imperative for increased NASA science investment. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
