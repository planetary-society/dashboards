    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.
    All AI-generated claims, assessments, and recommendations should be independently verified.
    This is an experimental feature, and intended to provide guidance and inspiration for outreach strategies for your meeting. Feedback is welcome: casey.dreier@planetary.org.

<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Crow's district benefits from direct NASA investments in space science, including a significant contract for Mars Sample Return facility assessment and grants to the University of Colorado for Earth observation research. His general support for STEM education and opposition to federal research cuts also suggest a foundational receptiveness to scientific endeavors. Furthermore, his consistent advocacy for Colorado's broader space ecosystem provides a strong entry point for discussions on NASA's scientific contributions.</p>
<p>Despite these local ties, Representative Crow lacks direct committee assignments related to space, and his legislative agenda is heavily weighted towards national security and a wide array of domestic issues, potentially diluting his focus on NASA's Science Mission Directorate. While he supports climate science, his emphasis often aligns with national security implications rather than broader scientific exploration. Advocates will need to clearly articulate how increased NASA science funding directly benefits his district and aligns with his existing priorities to overcome competing demands and the absence of explicit, strong advocacy for NASA science in his recent public record.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider highlighting the specific NASA science investments in his district, such as the Mars Sample Return facility assessment at Merrick &amp; Company or the Earth observation research at the University of Colorado, to demonstrate direct local economic and academic benefits.</li>
<li>Explore how increased NASA science funding aligns with his stated support for federal research and STEM education, or how Earth science research contributes to national security interests he champions.</li>
<li>Look into preparing a brief, compelling personal story about how NASA's science missions have inspired you or directly benefited your community, connecting it to the tangible impacts within Colorado's space ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Jason Crow</h2>

</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local Mars Exploration Investment:</strong> Representative Crow's district benefits from a NASA contract awarded to Merrick &amp; Company in Greenwood Village, CO, for architect and engineering services related to a Mars Sample Return facility assessment. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Local Earth Science Research Support:</strong> The University of Colorado in Aurora, CO, within Representative Crow's district, received NASA grants for Earth observation and ecosystem accounting research, directly supporting NASA's Earth science activities. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Commitment to STEM Education:</strong> Representative Crow announced STEM funding at a Boys &amp; Girls Club in Metro Denver, and his district includes LWP Technologies LLC, which received NASA contracts for student and faculty workshops, indicating support for the future space science workforce. (CBS Colorado, 2024-09-03; USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Opposition to Federal Research Cuts:</strong> Representative Crow recently sent a letter to House and Senate Republicans urging against cuts to federal medical research grants, demonstrating a general principle of supporting federal investment in scientific research. (Rep. Jason Crow, 2025-02-14)</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for Colorado's Space Ecosystem:</strong> Representative Crow has consistently advocated for Colorado's role as a leader in the space industry, highlighting the state's workforce and infrastructure, including the University of Colorado which receives significant NASA funding. (Rep. Jason Crow, 2024-11-13; Rep. Jason Crow, 2021-06-09)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of Direct Committee Influence:</strong> Representative Crow holds no current space-related committee assignments, limiting his direct legislative platform to advocate for NASA's Science Mission Directorate activities and exploration programs. (Space_Committees)</li>
<li><strong>Competing National Security Priorities:</strong> Representative Crow's legislative focus includes strengthening national defense and military space capabilities, as evidenced by his work on the National Defense Authorization Act and efforts to bolster Buckley Space Force Base, which may prioritize defense-related space over purely scientific endeavors.</li>
<li><strong>Broad Domestic and Social Priorities:</strong> Representative Crow's public record indicates a strong focus on a wide range of domestic and social issues, including gun violence prevention, immigration reform, and significant medical research funding, which could compete for his attention and advocacy for NASA science.</li>
<li><strong>Climate Science Focus on National Security:</strong> While supporting climate science, Representative Crow's recent legislative efforts, such as reintroducing the National Security Climate Intelligence Act, emphasize climate change's national security implications, potentially narrowing the scope of his advocacy for broader Earth science research within NASA's Science Mission Directorate.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Explicit NASA Science Advocacy:</strong> Public records from the last 24 months do not show extensive explicit statements or legislative actions directly advocating for increased funding or expansion of NASA's Science Mission Directorate or exploration programs, beyond general support for science or defense-related space interests.</li>
