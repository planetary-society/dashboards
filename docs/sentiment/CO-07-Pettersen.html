    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.
    All AI-generated claims, assessments, and recommendations should be independently verified.

<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Pettersen's district holds a significant economic interest in NASA's Science Mission Directorate, with over $1.1 billion in contracts and grants, primarily through Lockheed Martin in Littleton for major planetary science missions such as OSIRIS-REx, Lucy, and MAVEN. Additionally, the Colorado School of Mines in Golden receives NASA grants for astrophysics and Earth science research, indicating diverse local engagement. Her public support for federal investments in American manufacturing and innovation, including the CHIPS and Science Act, suggests a general receptiveness to scientific and technological advancement.</p>
<p>However, Representative Pettersen does not currently hold a space-related committee assignment, which may limit her direct legislative engagement with NASA's activities. Her public record also indicates a primary focus on a wide array of domestic priorities, potentially diverting attention from advocating for increased NASA science investment. While she has expressed support for science, her statements often emphasize Earth science applications related to climate change, suggesting advocates should highlight the broader benefits of all NASA science disciplines and their direct local economic impact.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider gathering specific examples of how NASA's space science investments, particularly the Lockheed Martin contracts and Colorado School of Mines grants, directly create jobs and stimulate economic growth within the 7th district.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's broader space science activities, beyond Earth science, contribute to American innovation, manufacturing, and STEM workforce development, aligning with her support for the CHIPS and Science Act and local research funding.</li>
<li>Look into personal stories from constituents working on the planetary science missions at Lockheed Martin or the astrophysics/Earth science research at the Colorado School of Mines, highlighting how these projects impact their lives and contribute to the district's scientific reputation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Significant District NASA Investment:</strong> Representative Pettersen's district hosts over $1.1 billion in NASA contracts and grants, including major planetary science and exploration missions with Lockheed Martin in Littleton (OSIRIS-REx, Lucy, MAVEN, DAVINCI+, Mars Ascent Vehicle) and astrophysics and Earth science research at the Colorado School of Mines in Golden. This demonstrates a direct local economic and scientific interest in robust NASA funding. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Planetary Science and Exploration Program Alignment:</strong> Her district's substantial involvement in NASA's planetary science missions, such as OSIRIS-REx, Lucy, MAVEN, and DAVINCI+, through contracts with Lockheed Martin, indicates a direct programmatic alignment with and potential support for these specific scientific and exploration endeavors. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Astrophysics and Earth Science Research Engagement:</strong> The Colorado School of Mines in Golden, within her district, receives NASA grants for astrophysics research (EUSO-SPB2) and Earth science studies (cryospheric topography, Antarctic ice shelves), demonstrating local engagement in diverse NASA Science Mission Directorate disciplines. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for Science and Innovation:</strong> Representative Pettersen has publicly supported federal investments in American manufacturing and innovation, specifically referencing the CHIPS and Science Act, which provides broad funding for scientific research and development. This aligns with the goals of NASA's Science Mission Directorate. (Pettersen.house.gov, 2024-03)</li>
<li><strong>Support for Local Research Funding:</strong> Representative Pettersen has actively announced federal funding for research institutions in her district, such as the Colorado School of Mines, indicating a general support for federal investment in local scientific and technological endeavors. (Pettersen.house.gov, 2024-05)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of Direct Space Policy Oversight:</strong> Representative Pettersen has no current space-related committee assignments in the 119th Congress, which may limit her direct legislative engagement with NASA's space science activities. (Authoritative Committee Data, 119th Congress)</li>
<li><strong>Extensive Competing Domestic Priorities:</strong> Her public record indicates a primary focus on a wide array of domestic issues, including economic recovery, affordable housing, healthcare, and substance abuse, which may divert attention from advocating for increased NASA science investment. (Colorado Public Radio, 2024-10-14)</li>
<li><strong>Prioritization of Earth Science Applications:</strong> While supporting science and technology, her public statements frequently emphasize investments in research related to climate change, clean energy, and environmental protection, potentially indicating a greater focus on Earth science applications within NASA's portfolio. (U.S. Representative Brittany Pettersen, 2024-01-30; U.S. Representative Brittany Pettersen, 2025-07-29)</li>
