<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ranking Member, House Committee on Appropriations</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative DeLauro, as Ranking Member of the House Committee on Appropriations, is a key figure in federal spending decisions. She has explicitly opposed "senseless attacks on America's scientific supremacy" and cuts to "scientific goals in space," even co-releasing an alternative funding measure that specifically required NASA to continue all Science Mission Directorate missions under formulation. This demonstrates a clear stance against the type of deep cuts proposed for NASA's science activities.</p>
<p>While her extensive background in health policy indicates a strong focus on other critical areas, her district benefits significantly from NASA Science Mission Directorate investments, including astrophysics research at Yale University and optical technology development for space-based telescopes at Zygo Corporation. These local ties, combined with her stated opposition to science funding impoundments and proposed cuts, suggest she may be guardedly receptive to advocacy highlighting how increased NASA space science funding supports both national scientific leadership and local economic and research interests.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider how NASA's space science activities, such as Earth observation or advanced materials research, can offer insights or technological spin-offs that benefit public health or biomedical advancements, aligning with her strong advocacy for health policy.</li>
<li>Explore specific examples of how NASA Science Mission Directorate grants and contracts in her district, particularly at Yale University and Zygo Corporation, foster local innovation, create jobs, and support educational excellence.</li>
<li>Look into Representative DeLauro's public record of opposing cuts to scientific research and advocating for American scientific supremacy, framing increased NASA science investment as a direct continuation of these stated priorities.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Rosa L. DeLauro</h2>
<ul>
<li>Earned a Master of Arts in international politics from Columbia University.</li>
<li>Served as chief of staff for Senator Chris Dodd before entering Congress.</li>
<li>Strong advocate for health policy, including cancer research and women's health.</li>
<li>Authored the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act; supports alternative protein research.</li>
<li>Personally experienced ovarian cancer, advocating for biomedical research and screening.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Key Appropriations Role:</strong> As Ranking Member of the House Committee on Appropriations, Representative DeLauro holds a powerful position to influence federal spending, including NASA's budget, and has used this platform to oppose cuts to scientific research. (House Committee on Appropriations, 2025-07-15)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Opposition to Science Cuts:</strong> Representative DeLauro explicitly opposed the FY2026 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies funding bill, criticizing "senseless attacks on America's scientific supremacy" and the firing of scientists, including those advancing "scientific goals in space." (House Committee on Appropriations, 2025-07-15; Space Foundation, 2025-07-15)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support for NASA Science Missions:</strong> In an alternative Continuing Resolution (CR) she co-released in September 2025, a provision was included that "Requires NASA to continue all missions under formulation by the Science Mission Directorate," indicating direct support for ongoing science activities. (EPIC for America, 2025-09-18)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Advocacy Against Funding Impoundments:</strong> DeLauro has consistently challenged executive actions to freeze or disrupt congressionally approved federal funds, specifically noting that "Over $900 million in investments in NASA and other efforts to ensure the United States is the global leader in space" were put at risk by such actions. (House Committee on Appropriations, 2025-03-27; Connecticut Public, 2025-04-29)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Direct District Investment in NASA Science:</strong> Her district benefits from significant NASA Science Mission Directorate grants and contracts, including astrophysics research at Yale University and optical technology development for space-based telescopes at Zygo Corporation in Middlefield, CT. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competing Priorities Focus:</strong> Representative DeLauro's extensive background and advocacy for health policy, including cancer research and women's health, as detailed in her biography, coupled with her influential position as Ranking Member of the House Committee on Appropriations, indicates a potential prioritization of these areas that may limit support for increased investment in NASA's space science activities.
