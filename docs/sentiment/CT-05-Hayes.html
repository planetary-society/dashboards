    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.
    All AI-generated claims, assessments, and recommendations should be independently verified.

<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Hayes's lack of direct committee assignments related to space or appropriations presents a challenge for advocating for increased NASA science funding, as her legislative focus tends towards other domestic priorities like healthcare and education. However, her district benefits from substantial NASA contracts with Linde Inc. for critical gases used in space launch and scientific ballooning, which are essential for enabling science missions. This local economic connection provides a tangible link to NASA's broader operations.</p>
<p>Her background as a National Teacher of the Year and her recent Community Project Funding request for K-12 astrophysics education demonstrate a clear commitment to STEM workforce development and science literacy. While she may not be an overt advocate for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, these factors suggest she could be receptive to arguments that link robust investment in NASA's science activities to local economic stability, educational opportunities, and the preparation of future generations for STEM careers, especially given the potential impact of significant budget cuts.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider how NASA's space science missions directly inspire K-12 students and contribute to the STEM workforce development goals Representative Hayes champions, perhaps by sharing local examples or student stories.</li>
<li>Explore how the critical materials supplied by Linde Inc. in Danbury, CT, are indispensable for NASA's science missions, demonstrating the tangible local economic and employment benefits of federal space investment.</li>
<li>Look into how increased investment in NASA's space science can align with her broader focus on public education and federal investment, by highlighting how scientific discovery drives innovation and prepares the next generation for future challenges.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Jahana Hayes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Earned multiple degrees, including a master's in curriculum and instruction.</li>
<li>Served as a high school government and history teacher in Waterbury.</li>
<li>Recognized as the National Teacher of the Year in 2016.</li>
<li>Chaired a board providing advanced instruction for gifted students.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local NASA Contracts:</strong> Representative Hayes' district benefits from significant NASA contracts awarded to Linde Inc. in Danbury, CT, for essential liquid oxygen, hydrogen, and helium, critical for space launch and scientific ballooning operations. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Support for Astrophysics Education:</strong> Representative Hayes submitted a Community Project Funding request for FY2026 to support the Talcott Mountain Science Center for K-12 education in astrophysics and data science, directly aligning with NASA's science mission. (Congresswoman Jahana Hayes, 2025-04)</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for STEM Workforce Development:</strong> As a former National Teacher of the Year, Representative Hayes consistently advocates for robust public education funding to prepare students for future workforce needs, a goal shared by NASA's STEM initiatives. (Rep Jahana Hayes, 2025-02; Rep Jahana Hayes, 2025-06)</li>
<li><strong>Record of Bipartisan Federal Investment:</strong> Her vote for the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law demonstrates a willingness to support significant federal investments in projects deemed beneficial, suggesting potential openness to similar bipartisan efforts for NASA funding. (Rep Jahana Hayes, 2025-02)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of Direct Space Policy Role:</strong> Representative Hayes does not hold any current committee assignments in the 119th Congress directly related to space, science, or appropriations that would provide direct oversight or influence over NASA's budget and policy. (space_committees, 119th Congress)</li>
<li><strong>Focus on Competing Domestic Priorities:</strong> Her public statements and legislative actions consistently emphasize issues such as healthcare, education, food security, and local infrastructure, indicating these are her primary legislative focus areas. (Congresswoman Jahana Hayes, 2025-09; Congresswoman Jahana Hayes, 2024-03)</li>
<li><strong>Limited Explicit Advocacy for NASA Science and Exploration:</strong> While she has supported community project funding for K-12 education in astrophysics and data science, her broader public record does not frequently feature explicit statements or legislative efforts advocating for increased investment in NASA's Science Mission Directorate activities or exploration programs. (Congresswoman Jahana Hayes, 2025-09; Congresswoman Jahana Hayes, 2025-03)</li>
