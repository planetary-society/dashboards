<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative McBride's position on the House Science Committee offers a direct avenue for advocating for NASA's space science budget, and the significant local investments in space biology, astrobiology, and astrophysics research through grants to Blue Marble Space and the University of Delaware demonstrate existing district benefits from these programs. The presence of multiple local companies receiving NASA science-related contracts further highlights a tangible economic stake in the agency's scientific endeavors.</p>
<p>However, her public focus on healthcare, economic affordability, and social services suggests that increased NASA science funding might not be a top priority unless a clear, direct local impact can be demonstrated. While her district benefits from specific science contracts, her emphasis on applied science with tangible benefits for Delaware could lead to less advocacy for pure space science or exploration without obvious local connections. Given her stance on protecting existing budgetary allocations, she may prioritize defending current NASA science funding levels rather than actively championing significant increases, especially in light of proposed cuts.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider highlighting specific local NASA science grants and contracts, such as those at Blue Marble Space and the University of Delaware, to demonstrate how increased investment directly supports jobs, research, and economic activity within her district.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's space science activities, particularly in areas like space biology and human spaceflight physiology, can lead to innovations with terrestrial applications in healthcare, technology, and STEM workforce development, connecting to her stated priorities for families and economic well-being.</li>
<li>Look into sharing personal stories or testimonials from Delaware residents who have benefited from or been inspired by NASA's science programs, leveraging her background in advocacy and her role on the House Science Committee to illustrate the human impact and value of these investments.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Sarah McBride</h2>
<ul>
<li>Earned a bachelor's degree from American University in 2013.</li>
<li>Served as a Delaware State Senator from 2021 to 2025.</li>
<li>Previously worked as National Press Secretary for the Human Rights Campaign.</li>
<li>Interned at the White House, focusing on LGBTQ+ policy issues.</li>
<li>Authored a memoir and engaged in extensive political advocacy.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>House Science Committee Membership:</strong> Representative McBride's membership on the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology provides a direct platform for engagement with and influence over NASA's science budget and programs, offering opportunities for bipartisan collaboration on space policy. (House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, 119th Congress)</li>
<li><strong>Local Space Biology Research Investment:</strong> Substantial NASA grants totaling over $14 million to Blue Marble Space in Clayton, DE, for human spaceflight physiology, space biology, and astrobiology research, demonstrate existing federal investment and local interest in NASA's Biological and Physical Sciences and Planetary Science activities. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Local Astrophysics and Heliophysics Research Investment:</strong> A significant NASA grant of $2.2 million to the University of Delaware in Newark, DE, for the AESOP-Lite balloon instrument to study cosmic ray electrons, indicates direct local engagement and federal support for NASA's astrophysics and heliophysics research. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Local Scientific Technology Contracts:</strong> Multiple NASA contracts awarded to Delaware-based companies, including Herox, PBC, TA Instruments - Waters LLC, Phase Sensitive Innovations Inc, and Agilent Technologies Inc, for scientific services and equipment, highlight a local economic stake and federal investment in NASA's technological and scientific endeavors. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Competing Priorities Focus:</strong> Representative McBride's public statements consistently prioritize healthcare, economic affordability for families, and social services, which may limit her capacity or inclination to champion significant increases in NASA's broader space science budget over other pressing constituent needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Preference for Applied Science with Direct Local Impact:</strong> While her district benefits from NASA contracts related to space biology and cosmic ray research, her public statements often emphasize scientific endeavors with clear, tangible benefits to Delaware's economy, health, or environmental resilience, which could lead to less advocacy for pure space science or exploration programs without obvious direct local connections. [cite: USAspending, FY2022-FY2024; 5, 12, 17]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Budgetary Conservatism/Defense of Existing Programs over New Growth:</strong> Her consistent opposition to federal funding cuts, particularly those impacting social services and local programs, indicates a focus on protecting existing budgetary allocations. In a constrained fiscal environment, this posture might lead her to prioritize defending current NASA science funding levels rather than actively advocating for significant increases in investment for new or expanded space science and exploration activities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
