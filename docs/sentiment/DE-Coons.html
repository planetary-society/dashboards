<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, Senate Committee on Appropriations</li>
<li>Member, Senate Committee on Appropriations: Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Senator Coons's position on the Senate Appropriations Committee and its CJS Subcommittee offers a direct avenue for influencing NASA's budget, and his past support for NEO Surveyor and general concern for the "American science enterprise" are positive indicators. His chemistry background and advocacy for data collection, coupled with significant local NASA science grants to the University of Delaware and Blue Marble Space for space biology and astrobiology, suggest a foundational receptiveness to scientific investment.</p>
<p>However, Senator Coons faces broad fiscal scrutiny and competing priorities within the Appropriations Committee, often emphasizing preventing cuts rather than proactively pushing for substantial new growth in science funding. While he values science, his recent focus has also included specific non-space R&amp;D areas, which could divert attention from a significant increase for NASA's Science Mission Directorate beyond current levels.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider highlighting the significant NASA science grants to Blue Marble Space and the University of Delaware, emphasizing how these investments directly benefit Delaware's economy, research institutions, and workforce development.</li>
<li>Explore how increased investment in NASA's Science Mission Directorate aligns with Senator Coons' advocacy for planetary defense and his broader commitment to the "American science enterprise," leveraging his scientific background and appreciation for data-driven policy.</li>
<li>Look into how a strategic, proactive investment in NASA science, rather than just preventing cuts, can address long-term national priorities and foster innovation, potentially drawing parallels to his interest in high-tech materials or the value of scientific data collection.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Christopher A. Coons</h2>

<li>Previously served as New Castle County Council President and County Executive.</li>
<li>Co-sponsored the PROVE IT Act, directing DOE to collect greenhouse gas data.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Key Appropriations Role:</strong> As a member of the Senate Committee on Appropriations and its Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee, Senator Coons holds a direct and influential position over NASA's budget and can advocate for science programs. (Congress.gov, current committee assignments)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Planetary Defense Advocate:</strong> Senator Coons has expressed strong support for the NEO Surveyor mission, a planetary defense initiative within planetary science, emphasizing the need for adequate funding to ensure its timely development. (Congress.gov, S.Hrg. 118-536, 2023-2024)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Broad Science Investment Concern:</strong> Senator Coons voiced alarm during an Appropriations Subcommittee hearing over proposed cuts to the Department of Energy's Office of Science, highlighting the importance of the "American science enterprise" and mentioning the University of Delaware. (YouTube, U.S. Senator Chris Coons, 2025-05-21)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Local Economic &amp; Research Ties:</strong> Delaware institutions, including Blue Marble Space and the University of Delaware, have received significant NASA grants for space biology, astrobiology, and cosmic ray electron research, demonstrating a direct local interest in NASA's Science Mission Directorate. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scientific Background &amp; Data Emphasis:</strong> Senator Coons' academic background in chemistry and his co-sponsorship of the bipartisan PROVE IT Act, which directs the Department of Energy to collect greenhouse gas data, indicate an appreciation for scientific data and research. (Biography; Senator Chris Coons, 2023-06)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competing Appropriations Priorities:</strong> As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and its Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee, Senator Coons balances a wide array of federal funding priorities, including national security, defense, and other R&amp;D areas, which may compete with significant increases for NASA science. (Forbes, 2025-06; YouTube, 2025-06; YouTube, 2025-05; YouTube, 2024-03)</li>
<li><strong>General Fiscal Scrutiny:</strong> Senator Coons has frequently voiced concerns about the federal budget process, delayed budget submissions, and the negative impacts of continuing resolutions, advocating for thorough oversight of federal spending, which could lead to a cautious approach to significant new investments across all agencies. (Forbes, 2025-06; YouTube, 2025-05; YouTube, 2025-03)</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on Specific Non-Space R&amp;D Areas:</strong> While broadly supportive of science, Senator Coons has recently emphasized and advocated for investments in specific R&amp;D areas such as clean energy, hydrogen hubs, and defense technologies, which could represent competing priorities for new federal investment. (YouTube, 2025-05)</li>
<li><strong>Focus on Preventing Cuts Rather Than Proactive Growth:</strong> Recent actions by Senator Coons and the Senate Appropriations Committee, where he serves, indicate a primary focus on rejecting proposed cuts to NASA's Science Mission Directorate and other science agencies, rather than explicitly pushing for substantial increases beyond current funding levels. (AIP.ORG, 2025-07; YouTube, 2025-05)</li>
