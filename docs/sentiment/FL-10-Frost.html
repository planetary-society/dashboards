<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Frost's position on the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, coupled with his recent actions opposing NASA budget cuts and supporting the Artemis program, indicates a foundational interest in the agency. Crucially, his district benefits significantly from diverse NASA science investments, with the University of Central Florida receiving substantial contracts and grants for projects spanning Earth science, planetary science, and astrophysics. This direct local economic and scientific connection provides a strong incentive for him to support continued and increased funding for NASA's Science Mission Directorate.</p>
<p>However, advocates should be prepared to address his strong focus on social and economic justice issues, which may compete for legislative attention, and his potential prioritization of Earth science within NASA's portfolio. While he has expressed concerns about private sector influence and emphasizes immediate community benefits, the existing local science contracts demonstrate the tangible, high-tech job creation and research leadership that broad NASA science funding brings to his constituents, offering a compelling argument against the proposed deep cuts to the Science Mission Directorate.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider sharing personal stories or examples of how NASA's space science activities, especially those at the University of Central Florida, have inspired local students or contributed to the district's economy, connecting to his background in Civil Air Patrol or the Technology Student Association.</li>
<li>Explore how investments in diverse NASA space science missions, beyond Earth science, contribute to technological innovation and national security, aligning with his support for the Spacecraft Cybersecurity Act and his broader commitment to U.S. leadership in space.</li>
<li>Look into framing increased NASA space science investment as a foundational investment in future solutions and STEM workforce development, demonstrating how it provides long-term, tangible benefits that resonate with his focus on community well-being and his history of advocating for impactful causes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Maxwell Frost</h2>
<ul>
<li>Attended Osceola County School for the Arts; part of Technology Student Association in high school.</li>
<li>Served in the Civil Air Patrol cadet program, achieving the rank of cadet major.</li>
<li>Previously served as the national organizing director for March For Our Lives.</li>
<li>Engaged in political organizing since 2012 for various campaigns and organizations.</li>
<li>Received campaign support from crypto-related entities; later donated individual contribution.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Committee Leadership on Science and Space:</strong> Representative Frost serves on the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, which has direct jurisdiction over NASA, indicating a foundational interest in space policy and the agency's activities. (Congressman Maxwell Frost, 2023-01-31)</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy Against NASA Budget Cuts:</strong> Representative Frost co-led a letter in February 2025 to President Trump and the Acting Director of the Office of Personnel Management, expressing concerns over reported cuts to NASA's budget and personnel, emphasizing the impact on the Artemis program, national aerospace industry, and scientific discovery. (Congressman Darren Soto, 2025-02-28) This directly supports preventing cuts to NASA's budget.</li>
<li><strong>Support for Artemis Program Funding:</strong> During a House Science, Space &amp; Technology Committee hearing in May 2024, Representative Frost questioned NASA Administrator Bill Nelson about the Artemis program and co-led a bipartisan letter calling for additional Artemis funding to overcome delays and technical complications. (Forbes, 2024-05-01) This demonstrates support for a major NASA exploration program that includes significant science components.</li>
<li><strong>Local NASA Science and Research Connections:</strong> The University of Central Florida (Orlando, FL) in Frost's district receives substantial NASA contracts and grants for science activities, including Earth science (GOLD), planetary science (Lunar-VISE, Arecibo Planetary Radar, CLASS, photothermal spectroscopy), and astrophysics (exoplanet observations). (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024) This provides a strong local economic and scientific incentive for supporting NASA science.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on Spacecraft Cybersecurity:</strong> In July 2024, Representative Frost co-introduced the Spacecraft Cybersecurity Act, which mandates NASA to implement cybersecurity protection plans for contractors, stating that safeguarding NASA's space missions advances the country's leadership in space exploration and understanding. (The Floridian Press, 2024-07-12) This legislative action demonstrates a commitment to the integrity and continuation of NASA's space missions, including science activities.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competing Priorities Focus:</strong> Representative Frost's legislative agenda and public statements frequently highlight a strong focus on social and economic justice issues, including gun violence prevention, affordable housing, and healthcare, which may compete for legislative attention and federal resources. (Maxwell Frost for Congress, N.D.; Esquire, 2023-10; Reddit, 2025-03; The Hoya, 2024-04; Congressman Maxwell Frost, 2024-07)</li>
<li><strong>Prioritization of Earth Science within NASA's portfolio:</strong> While supportive of science, Representative Frost's public statements often emphasize NASA's role in addressing climate change and environmental justice, potentially leading to a stronger focus on Earth science activities over other science directorates if budget decisions require prioritization. (Congressman Maxwell Frost, 2023-01; Space Foundation, 2024-07; CBS News, 2024-08; Congressman Maxwell Frost, 2025-02)</li>
<li><strong>Scrutiny of Private Sector Influence/Government Spending:</strong> Representative Frost has expressed concerns about potential conflicts of interest with private contractors like SpaceX at NASA and generally advocates against "privatizing every aspect of our lives and wellbeing," which could lead to increased scrutiny of commercial partnerships in space exploration and science. (Congressman Maxwell Frost, 2025-04; Congressman Maxwell Frost, 2025-02; ActBlue, N.D.; YouTube, 2025-01)</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on Immediate, Tangible Community Benefits:</strong> Representative Frost's FY25 Community Project Funding guidelines prioritize "essential projects, such as those focused on public health and safety," indicating a preference for federal investments with direct and immediate local impact, which might implicitly influence his view on funding for fundamental space science. (Congressman Maxwell Frost, 2024-04)</li>
