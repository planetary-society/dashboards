<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology</li>
<li>Member, House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology: Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Webster's position on the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee and its Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee, along with his advocacy for relocating NASA Headquarters to Florida, suggests a foundational appreciation for NASA's mission and its economic contributions to the state. His participation in the FY 2025 NASA budget hearing also indicates direct engagement with the agency's funding, providing an avenue for advocates to discuss the importance of space science.</p>
<p>However, advocates face a significant challenge due to his consistent record of fiscal conservatism and opposition to what he considers "non-critical" federal spending, which could extend to increased NASA science investment. The relatively modest direct local economic impact from NASA science contracts within his district further limits a strong local incentive to prioritize this specific area. Therefore, advocates should focus on articulating the broader national and strategic value of space science, connecting it to innovation, job creation, and long-term economic benefits in a fiscally responsible framework.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching specific NASA space science missions that exemplify engineering excellence, technological innovation, or efficient resource utilization, which could resonate with his electrical engineering background and fiscal conservatism.</li>
<li>Explore how the scientific data, discoveries, or technological advancements from NASA's space science missions directly benefit Florida's economy, educational institutions, or workforce, reinforcing the "unique partnership" he champions with the CAPE Canaveral Act.</li>
<li>Look into the broader economic or societal impacts of the specific NASA science contracts within his district, such as the SOFIA project, to illustrate how these investments contribute to critical national capabilities or local job creation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Daniel Webster</h2>
<ul>
<li>Graduated from Georgia Institute of Technology with a B.S. in electrical engineering.</li>
<li>Owns and operates a family air conditioning and heating business.</li>
<li>Served 28 years in the Florida Legislature, including as Speaker of the Florida House.</li>
<li>First elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2010.</li>
<li>Previously served on the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Committee Leadership Role:</strong> Representative Webster serves on the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology and its Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee, providing direct oversight and influence over NASA's science and exploration programs. This role positions him to engage directly with NASA's budget and mission priorities, which are vital to Florida's robust aerospace industry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Advocacy for NASA Headquarters Relocation:</strong> He recently introduced the bipartisan CAPE Canaveral Act (April 2025) to move NASA Headquarters to Florida, emphasizing the state's unique and enduring partnership with NASA and its role as a launching point for ambitious space achievements. This initiative underscores his commitment to strengthening NASA's presence and operations within his home state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Emphasis on NASA's Mission and Economic Impact:</strong> In advocating for the NASA Headquarters relocation, Representative Webster highlighted that the move would "enhance NASA's mission, increase efficiency, and drive economic opportunity," indicating a positive view of NASA's overall value and its potential for growth. This perspective aligns with supporting robust funding for NASA's activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Engagement in NASA Budgetary Oversight:</strong> As a member of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, Representative Webster participated in the April 2024 hearing on the FY 2025 NASA Budget, demonstrating direct involvement in the legislative process that determines funding levels for NASA's various directorates, including science.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Local Economic Ties to Space Science:</strong> Companies within his district, such as Export Solutions Inc. in Oakland, FL, have received contracts for NASA's SOFIA project, an astrophysics mission, establishing a direct local economic connection to NASA's space science activities. This demonstrates tangible benefits of NASA science to his constituents. [cite: USAspending, FY2022-FY2024]</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strong Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Representative Webster consistently advocates for reducing federal spending and cutting what he deems "wasteful" programs, as evidenced by his votes on appropriations and budget resolutions in 2024 and 2025. (United States Congressman Daniel Webster, 2025; Nasdaq, 2025-07-18; Polk County GOP, 2024-03-22)</li>
<li><strong>Prioritization of Other Spending Areas:</strong> His public statements and votes frequently highlight priorities such as border security, veterans' benefits, and infrastructure, which may compete with increased investment in NASA science and exploration. (United States Congressman Daniel Webster, 2025; Dan Webster for U.S. Congress, 2025)</li>
<li><strong>Opposition to "Non-Critical" Spending:</strong> Representative Webster voted against the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, due to "excessive spending on non-critical programs and policies," indicating a willingness to cut funding for initiatives he does not consider essential. (United States Congressman Daniel Webster, 2024-03-22)</li>
<li><strong>Limited Explicit Advocacy for Overall Science Growth:</strong> While a member of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee and its Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee, and supportive of specific missions like NEO Surveyor, his public record does not extensively feature explicit calls for a general increase in NASA's overall science or exploration budget. (Congress.gov, 2023-2024)</li>
<li><strong>Modest Local NASA Science Contracts:</strong> NASA contracts within FL-11 for science-related activities (e.g., SOFIA project support, Riegl USA maintenance) are relatively small in value, potentially indicating limited direct local economic drivers for significantly increased NASA science investment. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
