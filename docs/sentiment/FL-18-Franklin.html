<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology</li>
<li>Member, House Committee on Appropriations</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Franklin's fiscal conservatism and emphasis on reining in spending suggest he may be cautious about increasing NASA's budget, particularly given the lack of direct NASA Science Mission Directorate contracts or grants in his district. His skepticism regarding human-driven climate change could make advocacy for Earth science initiatives challenging, and his focus as Environment Subcommittee Chair leans towards applied environmental research rather than broader space science disciplines. Furthermore, his strong support for defense spending may lead to competition for non-defense discretionary funds.</p>
<p>However, his membership on the House Appropriations Committee and chairmanship of the House Science, Space, and Technology Environment Subcommittee provide direct avenues for engagement on science policy and funding. His background as a Naval Aviator and his MBA from Embry–Riddle Aeronautical University indicate a foundational interest in aerospace and technology, and he has publicly linked aviation and space to "America's strength and global leadership." Advocates could highlight how NASA's science programs drive innovation, support high-tech job growth, and contribute to Florida's broader space economy, aligning with his stated priorities for advancing innovation and technology.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider how NASA's space science initiatives, beyond direct district contracts, foster technological innovation and maintain America's leadership in aerospace, aligning with his background as a Naval Aviator and his emphasis on "America First" innovation.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's broader space science activities, including Earth science, contribute to the foundational knowledge and technological advancements that underpin applied environmental research like weather forecasting and disaster readiness, areas he champions on the Science Committee.</li>
<li>Look into compelling personal stories or broader economic impacts of NASA science across Florida, demonstrating how these investments yield significant returns in terms of job creation, educational opportunities, and national prestige, even without direct district contracts.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Scott Franklin</h2>
<ul>
<li>Graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy with a Bachelor of Science degree.</li>
<li>Served 26 years in the Navy, including 14 active duty as a Naval Aviator.</li>
<li>Flew S-3 Viking aircraft, deploying overseas on multiple aircraft carriers.</li>
<li>Earned a Master of Business Administration from Embry–Riddle Aeronautical University.</li>
<li>Former CEO of an insurance agency and Lakeland, Florida city commissioner.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>House Science, Space, and Technology Committee Leadership:</strong> Representative Franklin serves as Chairman of the Environment Subcommittee within the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, indicating a direct role in science policy and oversight. This position allows him to influence environmental research, including Earth science activities, which he demonstrated by championing the bipartisan Weather Act Reauthorization Act of 2025. His work on this committee contributes to Florida's broader scientific and technological ecosystem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>House Appropriations Committee Membership:</strong> As a member of the House Committee on Appropriations, Representative Franklin directly participates in decisions regarding federal spending, including NASA's budget. This role provides an opportunity to advocate for investments that could benefit Florida's significant aerospace industry and research institutions. The House Appropriations Committee has shown bipartisan support for maintaining NASA's total funding levels, opposing proposed cuts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Aerospace and Aviation Background:</strong> His 26-year career as a Naval Aviator and his Master of Business Administration from Embry–Riddle Aeronautical University demonstrate a foundational understanding and interest in aerospace and technology. [cite: biography] Embry–Riddle Aeronautical University is a prominent Florida institution with strong ties to the aerospace industry. On National Aviation Day in August 2025, he publicly affirmed aviation's essential role in "America's strength and global leadership" and saluted "space pioneers."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Advocacy for Innovation and Technology:</strong> Representative Franklin has emphasized advancing "America First policy priorities to remain at the forefront of innovation and boost job growth" and "harnessing innovative technologies" for areas like weather forecasting. This general support for innovation aligns with the high-tech nature of NASA's science and exploration programs. His opening remarks at a March 2025 hearing on "The Future of the Blue Economy" highlighted the importance of combining NOAA's ocean science expertise with private innovation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support for Florida's Space Economy:</strong> As a Florida representative, he operates within a state that strongly advocates for its space industry, including efforts to attract NASA resources. While his district is not the "Space Coast," the economic benefits of Florida's space sector, including Kennedy Space Center, impact the entire state. He has publicly linked aviation and space to "America's strength and global leadership."</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Skepticism on Climate Science:</strong> Representative Franklin has expressed skepticism regarding human activity as the primary driver of climate change, which could impact support for NASA's Earth science initiatives.</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Representative Franklin consistently advocates for fiscal discipline and reining in wasteful spending, indicating a potential for scrutiny of government expenditures, including NASA's budget.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Direct District Economic Ties:</strong> No relevant NASA Science Mission Directorate contracts or grants were found within Representative Franklin's district. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Narrow Science Focus:</strong> As Chairman of the House Science, Space, and Technology Environment Subcommittee, Representative Franklin's stated priorities lean towards applied environmental research such as weather forecasting, disaster readiness, and agricultural technology, potentially diverting focus from broader space science disciplines.</li>
<li><strong>Prioritization of Defense Spending:</strong> Representative Franklin, a former Naval Aviator, emphasizes national defense and has supported significant defense appropriations, which may compete with non-defense discretionary spending like NASA's science and exploration programs.</li>
