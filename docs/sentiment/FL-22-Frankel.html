    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.
    All AI-generated claims, assessments, and recommendations should be independently verified.

<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Appropriations</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Frankel's receptiveness to increased NASA space science funding may be limited by several factors. Her district shows no direct economic benefit from NASA Science Mission Directorate contracts or grants, and her primary focus as Ranking Member on the National Security, Department of State, and Related Programs Appropriations Subcommittee suggests competing priorities within the committee. Furthermore, her public statements frequently emphasize domestic social and environmental issues, and she has not explicitly advocated for NASA science funding levels in recent records, making the proposed 47% budget cut a significant challenge.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, there are opportunities for effective advocacy. As a member of the House Appropriations Committee, Representative Frankel holds a critical position to influence federal spending. Her general support for "lifechanging research" and criticism of "disregard of science" indicate a potential openness to arguments for robust science funding, and her commitment to STEM education aligns with the long-term needs of the space sector. Advocates can leverage her general pro-science stance and her committee role, even without direct district ties, to highlight the broader benefits of NASA's scientific endeavors.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching specific examples of how NASA's space science activities, such as Earth observation data or technology spin-offs, directly contribute to public health, climate resilience, or environmental protection, aligning with her stated priorities.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's space science missions inspire STEM education and workforce development across Florida, connecting to her consistent support for education and the state's broader aerospace economy, even in the absence of direct district contracts.</li>
<li>Look into her specific legislative activities or statements within the National Security, Department of State, and Related Programs Appropriations Subcommittee to understand her primary focus, and consider how a robust U.S. space science program contributes to global leadership and international collaboration, which may resonate with her.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Appropriations Committee Role:</strong> As a Member of the House Committee on Appropriations, Representative Frankel holds a direct position to influence federal spending, including NASA's budget for science and exploration activities. (Lois Frankel Official Website, 2025)</li>
<li><strong>Support for Federal Funding:</strong> Representative Frankel voted for the Fiscal Year 2023 federal funding package, which included significant investments across various federal priorities. (Lois Frankel Official Website, 2022-12)</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for Research Funding:</strong> In a May 2025 Appropriations hearing, Representative Frankel emphasized the importance of federal funding for "lifechanging research" and criticized "disregard of science," indicating a general pro-research stance. (YouTube, 2025-05)</li>
<li><strong>Commitment to STEM Education:</strong> Through her role on the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies, she has consistently supported increased funding for education, which includes STEM fields vital for the space workforce. (Lois Frankel Official Website, 2025)</li>
<li><strong>Florida's Space Economy Alignment:</strong> As a representative from Florida, a state with a significant aerospace industry, her general support for federal investment and her role on the Appropriations Committee align with the state's interest in robust NASA funding, including for space exploration and fundamental scientific research as noted in a July 2025 Appropriations Committee report. (House.gov, 2025-07)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of Direct Local Economic Ties:</strong> No relevant NASA Science Mission Directorate contracts or grants were found for Florida's 22nd congressional district in recent fiscal years. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Competing Appropriations Priorities (International Affairs/Global Health):</strong> As Ranking Member of the House National Security, Department of State, and Related Programs Appropriations Subcommittee since January 2025, Representative Frankel's primary focus within the Appropriations Committee is on international diplomacy, development, and global health, which may limit her direct advocacy for NASA's science budget.</li>
<li><strong>Strong Focus on Domestic Social and Environmental Issues:</strong> Representative Frankel's recent public statements and press releases frequently highlight priorities such as public health, maternal care, Everglades restoration, and climate resilience, indicating a strong focus on these areas that may overshadow space science initiatives.</li>
<li><strong>Absence of Explicit NASA Science Funding Advocacy:</strong> Recent public records (last 24 months) do not contain explicit statements from Representative Frankel specifically advocating for increased NASA science or exploration funding levels, or rejecting cuts to these areas, beyond general support within broader appropriations bills.</li>
