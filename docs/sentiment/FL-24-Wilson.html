    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.
    All AI-generated claims, assessments, and recommendations should be independently verified.
    This is an experimental feature, and intended to provide guidance and inspiration for outreach strategies for your meeting. Feedback is welcome: casey.dreier@planetary.org.

<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, Planetary Science Caucus</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Wilson's membership in the Congressional Planetary Science Caucus and her vote for the CHIPS and Science Act demonstrate a general appreciation for federal investment in science and technology. Her support for local universities receiving NASA grants for STEM engagement and technology development, alongside her advocacy for Florida's aerospace workforce, suggests potential receptiveness to NASA's broader mission. However, the near absence of direct NASA Science Mission Directorate contracts or grants in her district presents a significant challenge, limiting immediate local economic incentive for increased investment in these specific activities.</p>
<p>While her broad legislative focus and consistent prioritization of social programs may lead to competing demands for federal resources, her demonstrated interest in science and STEM education offers a pathway for advocacy. Advocates should emphasize how robust NASA science funding aligns with her goals for a skilled workforce and scientific research in Florida, connecting the value of space science to local educational and economic opportunities, despite the lack of direct district contracts.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider preparing examples of how NASA's space science missions and discoveries can directly inspire K-12 students and support STEM education initiatives in her district, aligning with her background as an educator and founder of the 5,000 Role Models program.</li>
<li>Explore how increased investment in NASA's space science could create new opportunities for research partnerships and STEM engagement with local institutions like Florida International University and Florida Memorial University, building on existing NASA grants and her advocacy for the aerospace workforce.</li>
<li>Look into how NASA's space science research, such as Earth observation or fundamental physics, can contribute to broader societal benefits like climate understanding or technological innovation that aligns with her general support for science and technology investment.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Frederica S. Wilson</h2>
<ul>
<li>Earned a B.A. from Fisk University (1963) and an M.A. from University of Miami (1972) in elementary education.</li>
<li>Served as an elementary school principal in Miami.</li>
<li>Served on the Miami-Dade County School Board, founding the 5,000 Role Models program.</li>
<li>Served in the Florida House of Representatives (1998-2002) and Florida Senate (2002-2010).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Planetary Science Caucus Membership:</strong> Representative Wilson's membership in the Congressional Planetary Science Caucus demonstrates a direct interest in space science, research, and exploration, aligning with NASA's Science Mission Directorate activities.</li>
<li><strong>Support for CHIPS and Science Act:</strong> Representative Wilson voted for the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act in November 2022, which aims to strengthen America's research advantage and fuel innovation, indicating a general commitment to federal investment in science and technology.</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for Florida's Aerospace and STEM Workforce:</strong> Her official statements highlight her commitment to bringing high-paying aerospace and technology jobs to Florida and working with local educational partners, such as Miami-Dade College and Florida International University, to advance scientific research.</li>
<li><strong>Co-sponsorship of DOE and NASA Interagency Research Coordination Act:</strong> Representative Wilson co-sponsored H.R.1368, the DOE and NASA Interagency Research Coordination Act, which passed the House in March 2025 and provides statutory authority for collaborative research between the two agencies, including in science areas like dark matter.</li>
<li><strong>Local NASA Research and STEM Engagement:</strong> Florida International University (FIU) in Miami received NASA grants in May 2024 for Moon to Mars technology development, and Florida Atlantic University (FAU) received a NASA MUREP grant in September 2022 for STEM engagement with local high school students, including Florida Memorial University in her district.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of Direct Local Economic Ties:</strong> Representative Wilson's district (FL-24) has no recorded NASA Science Mission Directorate contracts or grants, which may reduce direct local economic incentive for increased investment in these specific activities. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Competing Social Priorities:</strong> Representative Wilson has consistently prioritized funding for social programs, healthcare, and education, opposing recent budget proposals that would cut these areas, suggesting potential competition for federal resources. (House.gov, 2025-05; House.gov, 2025-01; LegiStorm, 2024-03)</li>
<li><strong>Broad Legislative Focus:</strong> Representative Wilson's official platform outlines a wide array of legislative priorities beyond science and space, indicating a distributed focus across many issues. (House.gov, 2025)</li>
<li><strong>Limited Recent Specific Advocacy for NASA Science Growth:</strong> While a member of the Planetary Science Caucus, recent public records do not show explicit statements or actions from Representative Wilson specifically advocating for increased funding or growth in NASA's Science Mission Directorate activities or exploration programs. (No public record found)</li>
