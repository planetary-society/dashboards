<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Appropriations</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Wasserman Schultz's position on the House Appropriations Committee presents a significant opportunity to advocate for NASA's space science activities, and she has previously expressed support for NASA funding, noting Florida's "Space Coast" identity. Her broader interest in science and technology, as well as her willingness to support federal science programs like NOAA, suggest a foundational receptiveness to NASA's mission.</p>
<p>However, direct economic ties within her district to NASA's Science Mission Directorate are minimal, with very low contract values not directly linked to core science programs. While she has praised NASA funding that exceeded presidential requests, her public record does not indicate proactive advocacy for substantial growth in NASA's science budget, which will be crucial given the proposed 47% cut for FY2026. Advocates will need to clearly articulate the benefits of increased science investment beyond general NASA support to capture her specific attention amidst her broad legislative priorities.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider how to frame increased NASA science investment as a benefit to Florida's broader "Space Coast" identity and workforce, aligning with her past statements and her influential role on the Appropriations Committee.</li>
<li>Explore the specific work of Rhotheta International and Trad Tests and Radiations, Inc. in her district, and how these NASA contracts, though small, represent local economic activity and specialized STEM jobs, connecting to her broader interest in science and technology.</li>
<li>Look into how NASA's science mission, particularly in areas like Earth science or STEM education, aligns with her established interests in environmental protection and her background as an educator, finding common ground beyond traditional space advocacy.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Debbie Wasserman Schultz</h2>
<ul>
<li>Earned Bachelor's (1988) and Master's (1990) degrees in political science from University of Florida.</li>
<li>Served eight years in the Florida House of Representatives, then four years in the Florida Senate.</li>
<li>Worked as an adjunct political science instructor and public policy specialist at Nova Southeastern University.</li>
<li>Advocated for manatee protection and promoted early breast cancer screening efforts.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Appropriations Committee Role:</strong> As a Member of the House Committee on Appropriations, Representative Wasserman Schultz holds a key position to influence federal spending decisions, including those related to NASA's budget. (Congress.gov, 2025-08)</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for Increased NASA Funding:</strong> In September 2025, Representative Wasserman Schultz praised increased funding for NASA in a Commerce, Justice, and Science Budget Bill, expressing relief that it exceeded the President's budget request and highlighting Florida as the "one true Space Coast." (WESH 2 News, 2025-09)</li>
<li><strong>Direct District Economic Ties to NASA:</strong> Companies within her district, such as Rhotheta International, Inc. in Plantation, FL, and Trad Tests and Radiations, Inc. in Hollywood, FL, have received NASA contracts for specialized systems and radiation analysis software, indicating local economic benefit from NASA activities. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Broader Science and Technology Advocacy:</strong> A March 2024 press release from her office regarding a FY2024 government spending package listed "Science/Technology/Telecommunications" as a key area of focus, indicating a general prioritization of these sectors. (U.S. House of Representatives, 2024-03)</li>
<li><strong>Bipartisan Support for Federal Science Agencies:</strong> In September 2025, she secured bipartisan support for an amendment to protect NOAA forecasting facilities in a House funding bill, demonstrating a willingness to collaborate across the aisle to safeguard federal science-related programs. (U.S. House of Representatives, 2025-09)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competing Legislative Priorities:</strong> Representative Wasserman Schultz's public record over the last 24 months indicates a strong focus on a broad range of legislative priorities, including healthcare, immigration, gun control, and environmental protection, which may compete for her attention and advocacy efforts regarding specific NASA science investments. (LegiStorm, 2025; AFL-CIO, 2023; Wasserman Schultz, 2022)</li>
<li><strong>Limited Direct Local Economic Ties to NASA Science:</strong> The identified NASA contracts within her district are relatively small and not directly linked to the core scientific or exploration missions of NASA's Science Mission Directorate, potentially limiting a strong local economic incentive for increased investment in these specific areas. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Absence of Proactive Advocacy for Growth in NASA Science:</strong> While Representative Wasserman Schultz has expressed relief for NASA's budget being better than a presidential request during appropriations discussions, her public record does not prominently feature proactive statements or legislative initiatives specifically advocating for a significant increase or expansion of NASA's science activities or exploration programs. (WESH 2 News, 2025)</li>
