<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Vice Chair, House Committee on Appropriations</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Diaz-Balart's influential role as Vice Chair of the House Committee on Appropriations presents a direct opportunity for advocating for NASA's space science budget. His district benefits significantly from NASA science grants, with Florida International University receiving over $1.6 million for Earth science research on topics like vertical land motion, wetland water levels, and air pollution, directly impacting local academic institutions and communities. Furthermore, local companies in his district hold contracts supporting NASA operations and science instrumentation, demonstrating tangible economic ties to the agency's broader mission.</p>
<p>However, the current fiscal environment and his stated priorities for national security and fiscal responsibility pose challenges, as evidenced by the proposed overall reduction to NASA's budget in the FY2025 CJS bill. While he supports space exploration and Kennedy Space Center infrastructure, there is no explicit public record of his advocacy for increased funding for the Science Mission Directorate specifically. Advocates will need to clearly connect the value of NASA's science activities to his district's economic well-being and Florida's broader space leadership, particularly in light of the proposed FY2026 science budget cuts.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider highlighting the direct, tangible benefits of NASA's Earth science grants to Florida International University, connecting research on sea level rise, wetland health, air pollution, and tropical cyclones to the well-being and safety of his constituents.</li>
<li>Explore how specific local businesses in his district, such as K5 Defense LLC, contribute to NASA's science missions through contracts for instrumentation, showcasing the economic impact of science investments within the community.</li>
<li>Look into how increased investment in NASA's science activities, particularly Earth science, aligns with his stated support for government funding for renewable energy development and contributes to the scientific objectives of the Artemis program.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Mario Diaz-Balart</h2>
<ul>
<li>Studied political science at the University of South Florida.</li>
<li>Began public service as an aide to Miami Mayor Xavier Su√°rez.</li>
<li>Served in both the Florida House and Florida Senate.</li>
<li>Elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2002.</li>
<li>Supports government funding for renewable energy development.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Appropriations Committee Leadership:</strong> As Vice Chair of the House Committee on Appropriations, Representative Diaz-Balart holds a key position to influence federal spending, including NASA's budget for science and exploration.</li>
<li><strong>Direct District Benefits from NASA Science Grants:</strong> Florida International University (FIU) in his district received multiple NASA grants for science activities, including Earth science research on vertical land motion, wetland water levels, air pollution, and tropical cyclones, totaling over $1.6 million. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Support for Space Infrastructure:</strong> Representative Diaz-Balart secured report language in the Fiscal Year 2026 Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations bill emphasizing the need for investments to upgrade and expand Kennedy Space Center's spaceport infrastructure to support both governmental and commercial missions.</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for American Space Leadership:</strong> He explicitly supported the critical Artemis program in the FY26 CJS Appropriations bill, aiming to advance American leadership in space, which often includes significant science objectives.</li>
<li><strong>Local Economic Ties to NASA:</strong> Companies within his district, such as Pivotal Utility Holdings Inc. and K5 Defense LLC in Doral, FL, have received NASA contracts for services at Kennedy Space Center and for super pressure balloon instrumentation, demonstrating local economic engagement with NASA's operational and scientific endeavors. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competing Priorities:</strong> Representative Diaz-Balart's public statements consistently emphasize national security, border security, and fiscal responsibility as key budgetary priorities, which may lead to trade-offs impacting NASA science funding. (Diaz-Balart.house.gov, 2024-03; 2023-03)</li>
<li><strong>Overall NASA Budget Reduction:</strong> As Vice Chair of the House Committee on Appropriations, he is associated with the proposed FY2025 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (CJS) bill that includes a $1.1 billion reduction to NASA's overall budget compared to the President's request, indicating a challenging environment for increased investment. (Appropriations.house.gov, 2024-07)</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on Exploration:</strong> Public statements from his office frequently highlight support for "space exploration" and the Artemis program, potentially indicating a prioritization of these over the Science Mission Directorate's activities within a constrained budget. (Diaz-Balart.house.gov, 2024-03; 2023-03)</li>
<li><strong>Limited Explicit Science Advocacy:</strong> No recent public record explicitly details his advocacy for increased funding or protection of specific NASA Science Mission Directorate activities (astrophysics, planetary science, heliophysics, Earth science, and biological and physical sciences) beyond general appropriations.</li>
