<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Carter's strong fiscal conservatism and consistent emphasis on reducing government spending present a significant challenge for advocating increased NASA space science funding. His legislative focus is primarily on healthcare and local defense, and he holds no direct space-related committee assignments, limiting his formal platform for championing these initiatives. Furthermore, his expressed desire for stringent oversight of federally funded research suggests he may scrutinize NASA science budgets, particularly in light of proposed cuts.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, there are potential points of connection. His co-sponsorship of the DOE and NASA Interagency Research Coordination Act indicates an openness to specific science collaborations, such as dark matter research. Local institutions like the Savannah College of Art and Design have received NASA grants for Earth science communication, and Gulfstream Aerospace in his district holds NASA contracts, demonstrating tangible local benefits. His leadership in the Sustainable Aviation Caucus and advocacy for ocean carbon removal research also suggest an interest in environmental science and technological innovation that could align with certain NASA science programs.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider highlighting the local economic benefits of NASA's broader activities, such as how contracts with Gulfstream Aerospace for aircraft support NASA missions, and how grants like the one to SCAD foster local talent and innovation, connecting directly to his district's economy.</li>
<li>Explore how increased investment in NASA's space science, particularly Earth science, aligns with his interest in sustainable aviation and ocean carbon removal research, demonstrating how NASA's data and research contribute to solutions for environmental challenges he champions.</li>
<li>Look into specific examples of how NASA science investments demonstrate strong returns on investment, foster interagency collaboration (like the DOE/NASA act he co-sponsored), or lead to practical technological advancements, to address his emphasis on fiscal responsibility and effective use of taxpayer funds.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Support for NASA-DOE Research Collaboration:</strong> Representative Carter co-sponsored H.R.1368, the DOE and NASA Interagency Research Coordination Act, which provides statutory authority for a research and development partnership between the two agencies, including research in areas like dark matter. (Congress.gov, 2025-03)</li>
<li><strong>Local NASA Earth Science Communication Investment:</strong> The Savannah College of Art and Design, located in his district, received a NASA grant for "Creating innovative ways to communicate ICESat-2's scientific mission," directly linking local institutions to NASA's Earth science activities. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Engagement with Local Aerospace Industry Supporting NASA:</strong> Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation in Savannah, GA, a company in his district, received NASA contracts for aircraft modifications and maintenance, indicating a local aerospace connection to NASA's operational needs. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Leadership in Sustainable Aviation Initiatives:</strong> Representative Carter was announced as co-chair of the bipartisan Congressional Sustainable Aviation Caucus in April 2025, which focuses on reducing the aviation industry's environmental impact and integrating new technologies, aligning with broader environmental and technological innovation goals. (Representative Sharice Davids Press Release, 2025-04)</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for Ocean Carbon Removal Research:</strong> In March 2024, Representative Carter was reported to be pushing for Congress to invest $165 million in efforts to increase the carbon-absorbing capacity of the world's oceans through his "Ocean Restoration Research and Development Act" (H.R. 7797), demonstrating support for environmental science research. (E&amp;E News, 2024-03)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strong Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Representative Carter consistently emphasizes balancing the budget, reducing government spending, and identifying waste, which may lead to scrutiny of NASA's overall budget, including science activities. (U.S. Representative Buddy Carter, 2025-03; U.S. Representative Buddy Carter, 2025-06)</li>
<li><strong>Primary Legislative Focus on Healthcare and Local Defense:</strong> His recent legislative efforts and committee leadership roles are heavily concentrated on healthcare and securing defense funding for his district, indicating these are his primary legislative priorities. (U.S. Representative Buddy Carter, 2025-09; U.S. Representative Buddy Carter, 2025-05)</li>
<li><strong>Skepticism and Oversight of Federally Funded Research:</strong> Representative Carter has introduced legislation to increase transparency for taxpayer-funded foreign research and criticized federal grant programs, suggesting a desire for stringent oversight that could extend to NASA science initiatives. (U.S. Representative Buddy Carter, 2024-06; House Energy and Commerce Committee, 2024-11)</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Direct Space-Related Committee Assignments:</strong> Representative Carter holds no current space-related committee assignments in the 119th Congress, limiting his formal platform to champion NASA space science within the legislative process. (space_committees)</li>
<li><strong>Focus on Local Environmental Resilience over Broad Earth Science Research:</strong> While he has supported local projects addressing sea level rise, his public engagement on environmental issues tends to prioritize local resilience and industry-specific sustainability rather than advocating for broad Earth science research funding. (U.S. Representative Buddy Carter, 2024-03; Representative Sharice Davids - House.gov, 2024-06)</li>
