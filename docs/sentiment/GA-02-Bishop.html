<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Appropriations</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Bishop's position on the House Appropriations Committee offers a direct avenue for influence, and his general support for science, technology, and local STEM education provides a positive foundation. However, his primary focus within the committee lies with agriculture and military construction, not the subcommittees directly funding NASA's science missions. The committee's emphasis on fiscal restraint and the limited direct economic ties to NASA's Science Mission Directorate in his district present considerable challenges for advocating for increased investment, especially against a proposed 47% cut.</p>
<p>Despite these hurdles, his support for aerospace-relevant material science research and the presence of NASA-funded research at Mercer University indicate an appreciation for scientific endeavors. Framing increased NASA science funding as vital for national defense, economic leadership, and the scientific workforce he champions locally could be a persuasive approach, offering a guarded optimism for advocacy efforts.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching how increased NASA space science funding directly translates into demand for the skilled STEM workforce he champions at institutions like Mercer and Albany State, providing local students with future career pathways.</li>
<li>Explore how specific NASA space science missions, such as Earth observation for climate resilience or astrophysics for technological innovation, align with his stated priorities for national defense, economic leadership, and improving quality of life in Middle and Southwest Georgia.</li>
<li>Look into how NASA's broader space science portfolio, beyond direct contracts, fosters fundamental research and technological advancements that could benefit aerospace-related industries and research at local institutions like Mercer University, building on his support for material science grants.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Sanford D. Bishop</h2>
<ul>
<li>Earned a B.A. from Morehouse College and a J.D. from Emory University School of Law.</li>
<li>Served in the United States Army from 1969 to 1971.</li>
<li>Operated a law firm in Columbus, Georgia, prior to congressional service.</li>
<li>Served in the Georgia House of Representatives and State Senate.</li>
<li>Received the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award from the Boy Scouts of America.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Appropriations Committee Role:</strong> As a Member of the House Committee on Appropriations, Representative Bishop directly influences federal funding decisions, including those for NASA, with the committee's FY2026 report (July 2025) explicitly supporting continued funding for critical science missions and space exploration.</li>
<li><strong>General Advocacy for Science and Technology:</strong> Representative Bishop's official website emphasizes that supporting scientific and technological advances, including robust funding for STEAM programs, is foundational for national defense, economic leadership, and improving quality of life, specifically mentioning benefits for Middle and Southwest Georgia.</li>
<li><strong>Local NASA-Funded Research:</strong> A NASA grant was awarded to Mercer University in Macon, GA, within his district, for assistive technology research, demonstrating a direct local connection to NASA's broader mission. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Support for Aerospace-Relevant Material Science Research:</strong> Representative Bishop announced a National Science Foundation grant to Mercer University in September 2024 for material science research equipment, specifically noting its applications in aerospace industries and studies of material erosion.</li>
<li><strong>Commitment to Local STEM Education and Research:</strong> He has consistently announced and supported National Science Foundation grants to local institutions like Mercer University (April 2024) and Albany State University (September 2024) to promote STEM education and research, fostering the scientific workforce vital for future space endeavors.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competing Priorities:</strong> Representative Bishop's public statements and official website highlight a broad range of legislative priorities, including healthcare, agriculture, economic development, education, and veterans' affairs, which may compete for his attention and support for increased NASA space science funding. (House.gov, Undated; YouTube, 2025-09-09)</li>
<li><strong>Focus on Specific Appropriations Subcommittees:</strong> As the Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food &amp; Drug Administration, and Related Agencies, and a member of the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee, his primary focus within the appropriations process may be directed towards these specific areas. (House.gov, Undated)</li>
<li><strong>Limited Direct NASA SMD Economic Ties:</strong> The only relevant award found in his district is a grant to Mercer University for assistive technology, which does not directly involve NASA's Science Mission Directorate activities or exploration programs, potentially limiting a direct economic advocacy angle for these specific NASA areas. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on Fiscal Restraint:</strong> As a member of the House Committee on Appropriations, he operates within a committee that, in its FY2026 report, emphasizes "reducing the size of the Federal Government" and "scaling back unsustainable spending levels," which could pose a challenge for advocating for increased NASA science investment. (House Appropriations Committee Report, 2025-07-24)</li>
