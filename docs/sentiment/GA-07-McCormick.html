<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology</li>
<li>Member, House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology: Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative McCormick's direct involvement in the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, particularly as Chairman of the Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee and the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, positions him as a key voice on NASA's budget. His expressed support for American space leadership, the Artemis initiative, and his medical background-driven interest in human physiology in microgravity suggest a foundational receptiveness to NASA's broader mission and scientific research. Furthermore, local contracts in his district, like those with Georgia Thermal Products LLC, demonstrate a tangible economic benefit from NASA's activities, which could make him more amenable to investments that support such local industries.</p>
<p>However, advocates should anticipate skepticism regarding specific science areas, particularly Earth science, given his past questioning of climate change funding priorities. His consistent emphasis on NASA's efficiency, fiscal conservatism, and commitment to oversight as Chairman of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee indicate a strong focus on accountability and cost-effectiveness. Advocates should be prepared to articulate how increased science funding aligns with national security, economic growth, and efficient use of taxpayer dollars, addressing his concerns about "unsustainable fiscal trajectory" and "poor financial management" within NASA.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider how NASA's space science research, particularly in areas like human physiology in microgravity or astrobiology, directly contributes to medical advancements and understanding life, aligning with his background as a physician.</li>
<li>Explore the specific contributions of local companies like Georgia Thermal Products LLC to NASA's science missions, highlighting how investments in space science create high-tech jobs and economic benefits within his district.</li>
<li>Look into specific examples of how NASA's science programs leverage commercial partnerships, promote efficiency, and foster innovation that leads to private sector growth, addressing his concerns about cost-effectiveness and oversight.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Richard McCormick</h2>
<ul>
<li>Earned a Bachelor of Science (1990) and a Doctor of Medicine (2010).</li>
<li>Served over 20 years in Marine Corps (Naval Aviator) and Navy (Medical Corps officer).</li>
<li>Piloted CH-53E Super Stallion helicopters as a Marine Corps Naval Aviator.</li>
<li>Practices as an emergency physician at Gwinnett Medical Center.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Committee Leadership:</strong> As a member of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology and its Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee, Representative McCormick is directly involved in legislative oversight and funding decisions for NASA's programs. He also serves as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations within the same committee, indicating a significant role in ensuring accountability and effectiveness across science and technology agencies, including NASA.</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for American Space Leadership and Artemis:</strong> Representative McCormick has publicly expressed his dedication to maintaining American leadership in space and supports the Artemis initiative for lunar exploration, viewing it as crucial for national security, economic growth, and technological advancement.</li>
<li><strong>Interest in Space Science and Human Physiology:</strong> Drawing on his medical background, Representative McCormick has demonstrated a specific interest in the scientific research community's needs, including questioning NASA officials on human physiology in microgravity and potential medical advancements for astronauts.</li>
<li><strong>Local NASA-Related Contracts:</strong> Companies in his district, such as Georgia Thermal Products LLC in Cumming, GA, have received NASA contracts for thermal protection system equipment, indicating a direct local economic benefit from NASA's technological and scientific endeavors. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Engagement with Local NASA-Funded Research:</strong> Representative McCormick toured Georgia Tech labs with NASA Deputy Administrator Pam Melroy, observing NASA-funded research in deep space exploration and electric propulsion, and highlighting the institution's "cutting-edge" contributions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Skepticism on Earth Science Funding:</strong> Representative McCormick questioned NASA Administrator Nelson on the causes of climate change, suggesting that funding should be directed towards "things we can change" rather than solely focusing on methane and carbon dioxide, indicating potential resistance to certain Earth science research areas.</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on NASA Efficiency and Commercialization:</strong> Representative McCormick has consistently highlighted NASA's inefficiencies, including "constant deadline extensions" and "poor financial management," advocating for increased private sector collaboration and cost-effectiveness in space programs.</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservative Stance:</strong> Representative McCormick's focus on addressing the nation's "unsustainable fiscal trajectory" and introducing legislation like the "Incentivize Savings Act" suggests a general inclination towards limiting government spending, which could impact NASA science budgets.</li>
<li><strong>Oversight and Accountability Role:</strong> As Chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, Representative McCormick is committed to "oversight and accountability" within federal agencies, which could lead to rigorous scrutiny of NASA's science programs and their perceived value.</li>
<li><strong>Broad Policy Priorities:</strong> Representative McCormick's public statements and committee assignments indicate a wide array of policy priorities, including national security, defense, and healthcare, which means NASA science funding must compete for attention and resources.</li>
