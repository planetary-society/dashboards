<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Scott's consistent record of fiscal conservatism and advocacy for reduced federal spending presents a significant challenge for securing increased NASA space science funding, particularly given the proposed FY2026 cuts. His lack of space-related committee assignments and prominent focus on defense and agriculture as legislative priorities suggest that space science may not be a top concern. Furthermore, his past votes against climate-related measures indicate potential resistance to NASA's Earth science activities.</p>
<p>However, there are specific avenues for engagement. The presence of Space Power Electronics Inc. in his district, which has received NASA contracts for specialized electronics, offers a direct local economic tie to NASA's technical work that advocates can highlight. His office's active solicitation of appropriations requests for the Commerce-Justice-Science subcommittee also provides a direct channel for constituents to advocate for NASA funding, allowing for a focused discussion on the economic and scientific benefits to his district and the nation.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching the specific work performed by Space Power Electronics Inc. in Bonaire, GA, for NASA science, and how these contracts translate into local jobs, technological innovation, and economic benefit for the 8th District.</li>
<li>Explore how to frame NASA science investments as fiscally responsible, high-return endeavors that contribute to national competitiveness and long-term economic growth, potentially aligning with his background in risk management.</li>
<li>Look into preparing a concise, personal story or local example that illustrates the tangible benefits of NASA science, which can be submitted through his office's open appropriations request process for the Commerce-Justice-Science subcommittee.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Austin Scott</h2>

</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local NASA Contracts:</strong> Space Power Electronics Inc. in Bonaire, GA, within Representative Scott's district, received multiple NASA contracts totaling over $120,000 between FY2022 and FY2024 for specialized laser and detector electronics, indicating a direct local economic interest in NASA's technical activities. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Engagement in Appropriations Process:</strong> Representative Scott's office actively solicits Fiscal Year 2026 appropriations requests for the "Commerce-Justice-Science" subcommittee, which includes NASA, providing a direct channel for constituents to advocate for NASA funding. (Congressman Austin Scott, 2025-04)</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for Aerospace and Defense Industry:</strong> Representative Scott has discussed the impact of international events on key Georgia industries, including aerospace and defense, suggesting a general understanding and support for high-tech sectors that often intersect with space exploration and technology development. (YouTube, 2025-06)</li>
<li><strong>Background in Risk Management:</strong> His academic background with a BBA in risk management and insurance from the University of Georgia and professional experience as an insurance broker may indicate an analytical approach to investments and a potential appreciation for the long-term returns and risk mitigation inherent in scientific and technological endeavors like space science. (LegiStorm, 2025)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Representative Scott has a consistent public record of advocating for reduced federal spending and fiscal responsibility, including supporting rescissions of appropriated funds and discussing the need for spending cuts to balance the budget. (YouTube, 2025-02; YouTube, 2023-06; SaportaReport, 2025-04)</li>
<li><strong>No Space-Related Committee Assignments:</strong> Representative Scott does not hold any current space-related committee assignments in the 119th Congress, which may limit his direct influence or advocacy for NASA's science and exploration programs. (space_committees)</li>
<li><strong>Competing Legislative Priorities:</strong> Representative Scott's official "Issues" page and recent public statements prominently feature defense, national security, and agriculture as key legislative priorities, with no explicit mention of space or science. (United States Congressman Austin Scott, Issues; Warner Robins Today, 2025-09)</li>
<li><strong>Opposition to Earth Science/Climate Action:</strong> Representative Scott's voting record includes votes against measures related to climate and environmental justice, indicating a potential lack of support for NASA's Earth science activities. (League of Conservation Voters, 2024)</li>
<li><strong>Limited Public Advocacy for NASA Science:</strong> The public record does not prominently feature recent statements or legislative actions from Representative Scott specifically advocating for NASA's Science Mission Directorate activities or exploration programs.</li>
