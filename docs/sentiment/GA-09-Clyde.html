<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Appropriations</li>
<li>Member, House Committee on Appropriations: Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Clyde's strong fiscal conservatism and consistent advocacy for reducing government spending suggest he will be highly scrutinizing of requests for increased NASA science funding, especially given the proposed 47% budget cut for FY2026. His expressed skepticism regarding climate science may also present a challenge when advocating for NASA's Earth science activities. While his district has some NASA contracts, the direct economic ties specifically to the Science Mission Directorate are relatively small, potentially limiting a strong local incentive for significant increases in science investment.</p>
<p>However, his membership on the House Appropriations Committee and the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee offers a direct and crucial avenue for engagement on NASA's budget. His participation in recent NASA budget hearings indicates an awareness of the agency's role in STEM and wealth creation, and his military background may foster an appreciation for advanced technology and research. Advocates should focus on the broader technological spin-offs and national benefits of NASA science, leveraging his committee role to highlight these connections.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching how NASA's science-driven technological advancements, particularly in areas like advanced manufacturing or data applications, align with Representative Clyde's naval aviation background and could benefit existing district contractors.</li>
<li>Explore specific examples of how NASA science investments generate economic returns through technological spin-offs and private sector job growth, framing these benefits in terms of fiscal responsibility and efficient use of taxpayer dollars.</li>
<li>Look into how NASA's scientific data and research, particularly in areas like Earth observation or advanced sensing, can provide tangible benefits for national security, border monitoring, or public safety, aligning with his stated priorities.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Andrew S. Clyde</h2>
<ul>
<li>Holds BBA from Bethel University and MBA from University of Georgia.</li>
<li>Served 28 years in U.S. Navy, including naval aviation units; retired as Commander.</li>
<li>Founded and operated Clyde Armory, Inc., a successful gun store.</li>
<li>Advocated for civil asset forfeiture reform, leading to federal legislation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Appropriations Committee Membership:</strong> Representative Clyde's position on the House Committee on Appropriations and its Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee provides a direct avenue for engagement on NASA's budget and priorities. (House Committee on Appropriations, 2024-07)</li>
<li><strong>Local NASA Contracts:</strong> Companies within Representative Clyde's district, such as Winton Machine Company and Nsi-Mi Technologies Inc. in Suwanee, GA, and Optima Stantron Corp in Lawrenceville, GA, have received NASA contracts for manufacturing and technical services, demonstrating a direct economic benefit from NASA activities in GA-09. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024) [cite: contracts]</li>
<li><strong>Engagement in NASA Budget Hearings:</strong> As a member of the CJS Subcommittee, Representative Clyde participated in the April 2024 hearing on NASA's FY2025 budget request, where the importance of NASA for STEM inspiration and wealth creation was discussed, indicating an opportunity to highlight the value of science programs. (House Committee on Appropriations, 2024-04)</li>
<li><strong>Support for Specific NASA Accounts in Appropriations:</strong> While the FY2025 CJS Appropriations bill proposed overall lower funding for NASA than the Administration's request, it recommended funding for several specific NASA accounts at the requested levels, suggesting a potential for targeted support for certain science or exploration programs. (Congress.gov, 2025-08)</li>
<li><strong>Military Background and Technology Appreciation:</strong> Representative Clyde's 28 years of service in the U.S. Navy, including naval aviation units, may indicate an appreciation for advanced technology, research, and national security applications, which align with aspects of NASA's scientific and exploration missions. (Biography) [cite: biography]</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Representative Clyde has consistently advocated for fiscal responsibility and reducing government spending, which could lead to scrutiny of budget increases for federal agencies, including NASA.</li>
<li><strong>Competing Priorities on Appropriations:</strong> As a member of the House Committee on Appropriations and its Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee, Representative Clyde is involved in allocating funds across numerous federal programs, potentially prioritizing other areas over significant increases for NASA science.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Direct NASA Science Economic Ties:</strong> While some district contracts exist for general manufacturing and technical services, the total value of NASA Science Mission Directorate-specific contracts in GA-09 is relatively small ($182K across FY2022-FY2024), which may limit a strong local economic incentive for increased science funding. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Skepticism of Climate Science:</strong> Representative Clyde has expressed skepticism regarding the severity of climate change and the scientific consensus, which could translate to less support for NASA's Earth science activities.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on Border Security and Law Enforcement:</strong> Representative Clyde has frequently emphasized issues such as border security and law enforcement in his public statements and legislative efforts, indicating these may be higher priorities for federal investment compared to expanding space science programs.</li>
