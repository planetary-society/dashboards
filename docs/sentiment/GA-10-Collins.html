<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology</li>
<li>Member, House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology: Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Collins's direct involvement on the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology and its Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee, coupled with his recent public statement expressing concern that "Any significant cuts to NASA's science funding would not only impact our space economy and workforce but could threaten our national security and technological leadership position," suggests a potential receptiveness to advocacy. The substantial NASA science grants totaling over $4.3 million to the University of Georgia Research Foundation in his district for Earth science, astrophysics, and planetary science projects provide a strong local economic and research benefit that aligns with his stated goal to keep the U.S. on the cutting edge of scientific and technological innovation.</p>
<p>However, his consistent advocacy for reduced government spending and past opposition to certain climate-related research present significant challenges, particularly for NASA's Earth science portfolio. Advocates should emphasize the national security, technological leadership, and economic benefits of NASA science, highlighting the direct local research impacts, while being prepared to address concerns about fiscal responsibility and the demonstrable returns on taxpayer investment.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching the specific impacts and real-world applications of the NASA science grants awarded to the University of Georgia Research Foundation, particularly how they benefit Georgia's economy, environment, or technological workforce.</li>
<li>Explore how increased investment in NASA's space science activities provides a strong return on investment for taxpayers, potentially through job creation, technological spin-offs, or contributions to national security, aligning with his emphasis on efficiency and value.</li>
<li>Look into how specific NASA space science missions and research leverage cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence to drive new discoveries, demonstrating alignment with his interest in scientific and technological innovation and his past leadership on AI in science.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Mike Collins</h2>
<ul>
<li>Graduated from Georgia State University in 1990 with a bachelor's degree in business administration.</li>
<li>Founded and operated a trucking company with his wife in the early 1990s.</li>
<li>Owned and operated several businesses prior to his congressional service.</li>
<li>Served as chairman of a large Georgia credit union and local chamber of commerce president.</li>
<li>No public record found of specific STEM or space-related professional experience.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Committee Engagement:</strong> Representative Collins serves as a Member of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology and its Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee, indicating direct involvement in NASA's oversight and policy.</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for NASA Science Funding:</strong> In May 2025, Representative Collins publicly stated that "Any significant cuts to NASA's science funding would not only impact our space economy and workforce but could threaten our national security and technological leadership position."</li>
<li><strong>Support for Local NASA-Funded Research:</strong> The University of Georgia Research Foundation, located in his district, received over $4.3 million in NASA grants for projects related to Earth science (e.g., coastal marsh carbon sinks, atmospheric processes) and astrophysics/planetary science (e.g., rovibrational collisional excitation). (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on Scientific and Technological Innovation:</strong> Representative Collins has consistently articulated a goal to "keep us on the cutting edge of science research and technological innovation" as a member of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee. (House.gov, 2023-02)</li>
<li><strong>Engagement in AI for Scientific Discovery:</strong> As former Chairman of the Research and Technology Subcommittee (118th Congress), Representative Collins led hearings in early 2024 examining how artificial intelligence can drive new scientific discoveries, a field with increasing relevance to space science data analysis. (Congress.gov, 2024-02)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Representative Collins consistently advocates for reduced government spending and fiscal responsibility, which could lead to scrutiny of NASA's budget, including science programs, in favor of cuts or reallocations.</li>
<li><strong>Opposition to "Politicized" Climate/Earth Science:</strong> He has voted against increasing spending for NOAA research on climate change impacts and supported measures to cut EPA spending and prohibit funds for "Environmental Justice Activities," indicating potential opposition to certain NASA Earth science initiatives.</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on Efficiency and Taxpayer Value:</strong> As former Chairman of the Research and Technology Subcommittee in the 118th Congress, he stated goals to ensure "taxpayers can rest assured that the research they invest in is money well-spent," suggesting a focus on demonstrable returns and efficiency that could challenge funding for foundational science.</li>
<li><strong>Preference for Commercial Space Utilization:</strong> In a February 2025 Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee hearing, Representative Collins questioned a witness about NASA utilizing commercial assets for activities the government can't uniquely perform, indicating a preference for private sector solutions over government-led initiatives where possible.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Direct STEM/Space Professional Background:</strong> His professional background is primarily in business and entrepreneurship, rather than specific STEM or space-related fields, which may lead to a greater reliance on economic or national security justifications for space science investments.
