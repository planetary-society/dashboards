    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.

<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Scott's primary legislative focus lies with agriculture and financial services, and he lacks direct committee oversight of NASA or science policy, limiting his immediate influence on space science funding. His district has also received no direct NASA Science Mission Directorate contracts or grants in recent years, suggesting a lack of local economic incentive for increased investment in these specific areas. While he supports the broader space sector, his emphasis has been on manufacturing, commercialization, and national security rather than scientific discovery.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, Representative Scott has expressed a desire for the U.S. to maintain global leadership in space investment and has consistently advocated for STEM education and federal research grants. These broader interests, particularly his support for clean energy research which aligns with NASA's Earth science objectives, could provide avenues for advocates to frame increased NASA science funding as vital for U.S. competitiveness and the STEM pipeline. Emphasizing how scientific discovery underpins future commercial and national security advancements may resonate.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Explore how NASA's space science investments contribute to the broader U.S. space industry's technological innovation and workforce development, aligning with the Representative's focus on economic leadership and the goals of the RAVES Reporting Act.</li>
<li>Look into specific NASA Science Mission Directorate initiatives or university programs that support STEM education, particularly for underrepresented groups, and could potentially connect with institutions like Fort Valley State University, aligning with the Representative's advocacy for HBCUs.</li>
<li>Consider how NASA's Earth science research, particularly in areas like climate monitoring and environmental impact studies, aligns with the Representative's expressed interest in clean energy research and broader federal R&amp;D funding.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About David Scott</h2>
<ul>
<li>Holds a bachelor's degree in finance and an MBA from the Wharton School.</li>
<li>Founded and operated a small advertising business in the Atlanta area.</li>
<li>Served 28 years in the Georgia House and State Senate before Congress.</li>
<li>No public record found of specific STEM or space-related professional experience.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Space Industry Manufacturing:</strong> Representative Scott introduced the RAVES Reporting Act (H.R.3697) in June 2025, which seeks to establish U.S. space-industry manufacturing hubs from abandoned sites, explicitly mentioning support for U.S. space exploration and commercialization, and seeking commercial input from agencies like NASA.</li>
<li><strong>STEM Education Advocacy:</strong> Representative Scott co-sponsored bipartisan legislation in January 2025 to grow and diversify STEM education, and the RAVES Reporting Act also includes expanded pathways for STEM education. This general support for STEM education benefits the pipeline for future space science professionals.</li>
<li><strong>Support for Federal Research Grants:</strong> Representative Scott's official website provides resources for constituents seeking federal grants and offers letters of support for federal grant applications, indicating a general posture of supporting federal research and development funding. He also reintroduced legislation in February 2025 to permanently extend federal scholarship funding for 1890 Land-Grant HBCUs, including Fort Valley State University in Georgia, for degrees in food and agriculture sciences.</li>
<li><strong>U.S. Leadership in Space Investment:</strong> In June 2025, Representative Scott emphasized the need for the United States to remain a global leader in space investment due to intensifying international competition, a stance that could extend to supporting NASA's scientific endeavors.</li>
<li><strong>Investment in Clean Energy Research:</strong> Representative Scott requested significant funding for Energy Frontier Research Centers and the Department of Energy's Office of Technology Transitions for clean energy research in the FY 2026 appropriations, demonstrating support for scientific research that can align with NASA's Earth science objectives.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>No direct committee oversight of space policy:</strong> Representative Scott does not hold any current committee assignments related to space or science, which limits his direct legislative influence on NASA's Science Mission Directorate activities and budget. [cite: <space_committees>]</li>
<li><strong>Primary focus on agriculture and financial services:</strong> His long-standing committee roles and legislative priorities are centered on the House Agriculture Committee and the House Financial Services Committee, indicating a primary focus on these sectors over space science.</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on economic development and national security in space initiatives:</strong> While supportive of space, his recent RAVES Reporting Act (2025-06) focuses on job creation, domestic manufacturing, and national security within the space sector, rather than explicitly advocating for scientific discovery.</li>
<li><strong>Limited direct economic ties to NASA science in the district:</strong> No relevant NASA Science Mission Directorate contracts or grants were found for Georgia's 13th Congressional District, suggesting a lack of direct local economic incentive for increased NASA science funding. [cite: <contracts>]</li>
<li><strong>Focus on local community projects:</strong> His public record frequently highlights securing funding for local infrastructure, job creation, and specific community needs within his district, which may prioritize local concerns over broader federal science investments.</li>
</ul>
