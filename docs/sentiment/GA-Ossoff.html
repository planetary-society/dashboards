<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, Senate Committee on Appropriations</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Senator Ossoff's role on the Senate Appropriations Committee offers a direct opportunity to influence NASA's Science Mission Directorate funding. His past support for robust NASA funding, including science, and his engagement with Georgia's research institutions like Georgia Tech, which receives substantial NASA science grants for astrobiology and planetary science, indicate a potential receptiveness to the value of these programs. His general support for strengthening Georgia's R&amp;D sector further aligns with the goals of increased science investment.</p>
<p>However, Senator Ossoff's public concerns about fiscal responsibility and the national debt, alongside a broad array of competing federal spending priorities for Georgia, suggest he may be cautious about significant budget increases. While he has advocated for "robust" NASA funding, there is no explicit public record of him pushing for <em>increased</em> overall funding for the Science Mission Directorate, which is critical in light of the proposed FY26 cuts. Advocates will need to clearly articulate the specific benefits and necessity of preventing such drastic reductions and securing additional investment.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching specific NASA science grants awarded to Georgia Tech Research Corp, focusing on how these projects contribute to scientific discovery, foster local innovation, and create high-tech jobs within Georgia, aligning with Senator Ossoff's support for R&amp;D and engagement with local institutions.</li>
<li>Explore data and examples that demonstrate the economic return on investment and national benefits of NASA's space science activities, framing increased funding as a strategic investment that aligns with Senator Ossoff's fiscal responsibility stance and interest in U.S. competitiveness.</li>
<li>Look into crafting concise, compelling narratives about the impact of NASA's space science discoveries, perhaps highlighting how they inspire future generations or contribute to our understanding of the universe, which may resonate with Senator Ossoff's background in storytelling and public interest in space-related themes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Jon Ossoff</h2>
<ul>
<li>Graduated Georgetown University (2009) and London School of Economics (2013).</li>
<li>Served as national security staffer and legislative assistant for Rep. Hank Johnson.</li>
<li>Managed an investigative production company, creating documentaries on global corruption.</li>
<li>Known for being "Extremely Online" with public interest in Star Wars.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Direct Influence on Funding:</strong> As a member of the Senate Committee on Appropriations, Senator Ossoff directly participates in decisions regarding federal spending, including allocations for NASA's Science Mission Directorate. Georgia-based institutions like Georgia Tech Research Corp receive significant NASA grants for science activities, making federal appropriations directly impactful to his constituents. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024) (Senate.gov, Current)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support for Research &amp; Development:</strong> Senator Ossoff has publicly announced new federal investments to strengthen Georgia's research and development sector, indicating a general posture supportive of scientific funding. Georgia Tech Research Corp in Atlanta is a major recipient of NASA science grants, including for astrobiology and solar system exploration research. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024) (Ossoff.senate.gov, 2024-03)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Engagement with Science Stakeholders:</strong> Senator Ossoff has engaged with Georgia's leading research institutions, such as Georgia Tech, discussing federal funding for research and innovation, which benefits NASA-affiliated science programs. Georgia Tech Research Corp holds multiple multi-million dollar NASA grants for projects in astrobiology and planetary science. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024) (Atlanta Journal-Constitution, 2023-11)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bipartisan Technology Leadership:</strong> Senator Ossoff co-introduced bipartisan legislation aimed at strengthening U.S. competitiveness in emerging technologies, demonstrating a willingness to collaborate on initiatives that often underpin advancements in space science and exploration. Strengthening U.S. competitiveness benefits research institutions and companies in Georgia involved in advanced technologies. (Ossoff.senate.gov, 2024-07)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Advocacy for Robust NASA Funding:</strong> Senator Ossoff was a signatory on a letter to the Appropriations Committee urging robust funding for NASA's critical missions, including human spaceflight, science, and aeronautics research. This action demonstrates direct support for the broader NASA ecosystem that benefits Georgia contractors and researchers. (SpaceNews, 2023-02)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competing Priorities Focus (Broad Federal Spending &amp; Georgia-Specific Projects):</strong> As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and ranking member of the Military Construction subcommittee, Senator Ossoff's public record highlights a broad range of federal spending priorities, including significant investments in Georgia's infrastructure, military installations, agriculture, and health, which could compete with increased investment in NASA science.</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal Responsibility Stance:</strong> Senator Ossoff has publicly stated concerns about the national debt and the country's long-term fiscal problem, noting that "Our capacity to borrow and spend is not unlimited." This general stance on fiscal responsibility could make him cautious about significantly increasing discretionary spending, including for NASA science, without clear justification or offsets.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Explicit Public Advocacy for Increased NASA Science Funding:</strong> While Senator Ossoff has demonstrated general support for scientific research, particularly biomedical and agricultural research tied to Georgia, there is no recent public record of him explicitly advocating for <em>increased</em> overall funding for NASA's Science Mission Directorate or exploration programs beyond existing levels.</li>
