    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.

<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Appropriations</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Case, as a member of the House Appropriations Committee, has a direct role in NASA's budget and previously supported $7.8 billion for NASA science in FY2023, emphasizing planetary and Earth science. His district benefits significantly from NASA science contracts and grants, particularly for Near-Earth Object surveys and Earth observation research at the University of Hawaii, providing a strong local connection for increased investment.</p>
<p>However, his recent vote against the FY2026 CJS Appropriations bill, which includes NASA science, suggests potential reservations about current funding proposals or competing priorities. While supportive of specific NASA-funded research in Hawaii, advocates should emphasize how broader NASA science investment directly sustains and expands these vital local programs and STEM workforce development, rather than assuming general support for overall budget increases.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching the specific reasons or concerns Representative Case expressed when voting against the proposed FY2026 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill in committee, to better understand his priorities and frame your advocacy for NASA science within that context.</li>
<li>Explore how the University of Hawaii's NASA science contracts and grants, particularly in Earth observation and planetary defense, directly benefit his constituents through job creation, STEM education, and local applications like disaster preparedness.</li>
<li>Look into how NASA's broader Earth science initiatives, which Representative Case has supported, provide data and research relevant to Hawaii's unique environmental challenges, potentially connecting to his past legislative focus on local regulatory issues.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Ed Case</h2>
<ul>
<li>Earned a bachelor's degree in psychology from Williams College in 1975.</li>
<li>Received a Juris Doctor from UC Hastings College of Law in 1981.</li>
<li>Practiced law for two decades, including as managing partner at Carlsmith Ball.</li>
<li>Served as Majority Leader in the Hawaii State House of Representatives.</li>
<li>Introduced legislation regulating tour airplane and helicopter flights in Hawaii.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Appropriations Committee Influence:</strong> As a member of the House Committee on Appropriations, Representative Case directly influences federal spending, including NASA's budget, and has demonstrated support for NASA science funding in recent appropriations bills, indicating potential for bipartisan collaboration on funding priorities. This role allows him to champion funding for institutions like the University of Hawaii, which receives significant NASA contracts and grants for planetary science, Earth science, and space geodesy. (U.S. House of Representatives, 2022-12; USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Direct Advocacy for NASA Science:</strong> Representative Case explicitly supported $7.8 billion for NASA science programs in the FY2023 omnibus federal funding package, emphasizing exploration of the solar system, other planets, and Earth's changing climate, reflecting a supportive stance that was part of a bipartisan effort to fund critical programs. This directly benefits local research, such as the University of Hawaii's projects in Near-Earth Object surveys and the Hyperspectral Thermal Imager (HYTI) for Earth observation. (U.S. House of Representatives, 2022-12; USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Commitment to STEM Education:</strong> He has highlighted the importance of STEM engagement, including $45 million for NASA's Minority University Research and Education Project, which supports Hawaii STEM programs, and questioned the sufficiency of proposed increases for STEM education, demonstrating a commitment to developing the future space workforce, an area often garnering bipartisan support. The University of Hawaii, a minority-serving institution, is a direct beneficiary of such programs, fostering a local pipeline for space-related careers. (U.S. House of Representatives, 2022-12; YouTube, 2022-05; USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support for Earth Science and Climate Research:</strong> Representative Case has specifically advocated for NASA science funding to advance scientific knowledge about Earth's changing climate, aligning with NASA's Earth Science Mission Directorate and demonstrating a supportive stance on this critical area, which includes bipartisan interest in disaster preparedness. Hawaii benefits from NASA's Earth science applications, such as the Guardian system for tsunami alerts, and local research like the University of Hawaii's HYTI project for monitoring hydrological cycles. (U.S. House of Representatives, 2022-12; The Times of India, 2025-09; USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Engagement in Space Policy Discussions:</strong> His participation in House Appropriations Subcommittee hearings on NASA's budget requests, such as the FY2025 request, indicates active engagement in shaping space policy and funding, providing opportunities for bipartisan consensus on NASA's scientific and exploration goals. This engagement indirectly supports the continued flow of NASA funding to Hawaii-based research institutions. (YouTube, 2024-04; USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vote Against FY2026 CJS Appropriations Bill:</strong> Representative Case voted against the proposed Fiscal Year 2026 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill in committee, which includes funding for NASA's science activities.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on Local Economic Impact:</strong> Representative Case's public statements and support for NASA-funded projects in his district often highlight their direct economic and scientific benefits to Hawaii, which may lead to a prioritization of projects with clear local ties over broader national or international NASA science initiatives without immediate district impact.</li>
<li><strong>Balancing Diverse Appropriations Demands:</strong> As a member of the House Committee on Appropriations, Representative Case is responsible for allocating federal funds across numerous sectors, requiring him to weigh NASA's science funding against a wide array of competing national priorities, potentially limiting his capacity to champion significant increases for NASA science.</li>
<li><strong>Historical Focus on Local Regulatory Issues:</strong> Representative Case has consistently reintroduced the "Safe and Quiet Skies Act" (most recently in February 2023), demonstrating a sustained legislative focus on local regulatory and quality-of-life issues related to air tour operations in Hawaii.</li>
<li><strong>Absence of Explicit Advocacy for Overall NASA Science Growth:</strong> While supportive of specific NASA-funded research within his district, public records do not show recent explicit statements from Representative Case advocating for a substantial overall increase in NASA's Science Mission Directorate budget beyond current levels. (No public record found)</li>
