<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Appropriations</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Hinson's strong fiscal conservatism and past opposition to broad spending packages, including a bipartisan infrastructure bill, suggest a skeptical stance towards increasing federal outlays, which could extend to NASA science funding. Her stated legislative priorities focus on border security, tax cuts, and agriculture, without explicit mention of space or science, and her support for cuts to environmental agencies may indicate a broader challenge for Earth science initiatives.</p>
<p>However, her position on the House Appropriations Committee offers a direct avenue for influence over NASA's budget. Crucially, she successfully advocated for Community Project Funding for astrophysics research at Coe College, which partners with NASA on projects like Mars ionosphere modeling. Furthermore, local businesses in her district have received NASA contracts for components used in scientific missions, such as slip rings for balloon payloads, rugged servers for Earth science radar, and flight management systems for airborne science operations, demonstrating tangible local economic and academic ties to NASA's scientific endeavors.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider emphasizing the local economic impact of NASA's science investments, specifically referencing the successful Community Project Funding for Coe College's astrophysics research and contracts with companies like United Equipment Accessories and Crystal Group in her district.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's science activities, particularly Earth science data or technology spin-offs, can directly benefit Iowa's agricultural sector or contribute to local economic growth, aligning with her stated priorities for the state.</li>
<li>Look into framing NASA science investments as a fiscally responsible use of taxpayer dollars, highlighting the long-term returns on investment in innovation, job creation, and national competitiveness, to address her concerns about government spending.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Ashley Hinson</h2>
<ul>
<li>Graduated from University of Southern California, studied broadcast journalism.</li>
<li>Began career as a television news anchor and editor for Iowa stations.</li>
<li>Served as an Iowa State Representative from 2017 to 2021.</li>
<li>Elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2020, representing Iowa.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Appropriations Committee Role:</strong> Representative Hinson's membership on the House Committee on Appropriations provides a direct avenue to influence NASA's budget, including funding for science programs. This role is significant given that Iowa businesses receive NASA contracts funded through the appropriations process. (Congress.gov, 2025-08-06)</li>
<li><strong>Local Astrophysics Research Funding:</strong> Representative Hinson successfully advocated for $225,000 in Community Project Funding for Coe College in Cedar Rapids, IA, for an Advancing Astrophysics Research Project, which includes modeling the ionosphere of Mars and developing spacecraft glass. Coe College has a strong partnership with NASA. (Hinson.house.gov, 2024-03-06; Hinson.house.gov, 2023-03-31)</li>
<li><strong>Local NASA Science Contracts (Balloon Payloads):</strong> United Equipment Accessories, Inc. in Waverly, IA, received a NASA contract for slip rings used in balloon payloads, which are often utilized for scientific research. This demonstrates direct local economic benefit from NASA science activities. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Local NASA Science Contracts (Earth Science Radar):</strong> Crystal Group, Inc. in Hiawatha, IA, received a NASA contract for rugged servers for npol radar, a system commonly used in Earth science research. This highlights local industry contributions to NASA's scientific missions. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Support for NASA Airborne Science Operations:</strong> Rockwell Collins, Inc. in Manchester and Cedar Rapids, IA, received NASA contracts for flight management system databases for a NASA C-130 aircraft, which supports various airborne science missions. This indicates local support for NASA's operational capabilities that enable science. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>General Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Representative Hinson has publicly expressed a commitment to reducing government spending, stating, "I'm on a mission to cut more and ensure taxpayers keep more of their hard-earned paychecks" in relation to a government funding package that included cuts to various agencies. (Hinson Statement, 2024-03)</li>
<li><strong>Competing Legislative Priorities:</strong> Her stated top priorities for her 2025 Senate campaign include securing borders, cutting taxes, and supporting American agriculture, with no explicit mention of space or science, suggesting other issues may take precedence in her legislative focus. (YouTube, 2025-09; Iowa Public Radio, 2025-09)</li>
<li><strong>Past Opposition to Broad Spending Legislation:</strong> Representative Hinson voted against the bipartisan infrastructure bill in 2021, characterizing it as "spending at its worst" and "Marxist ideology," which indicates a willingness to oppose large federal spending packages. (Newsweek, 2022-01)</li>
<li><strong>Opposition to Environmental Agency Funding:</strong> Representative Hinson supported a government funding package that included significant cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Biden Administration's environmental justice budget, which may indicate a broader skepticism towards federal funding for environmental and Earth science initiatives. (Hinson Statement, 2024-03)</li>
