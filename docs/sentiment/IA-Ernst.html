<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Senator Ernst's consistent fiscal conservatism and past criticism of NASA's exploration costs present a significant challenge for advocating increased NASA space science funding. Her skepticism regarding climate science also suggests potential resistance to Earth science initiatives. Furthermore, her primary engagement with space policy has focused on national security, and she does not sit on committees with direct NASA oversight, indicating civil space science may not be a top priority.</p>
<p>However, there are clear opportunities for engagement. Iowa receives substantial NASA science investments, particularly at the University of Iowa for heliophysics and general science, providing a strong local economic and research argument. Her support for STEM education, small business innovation programs, and domestic research and development aligns with the broader benefits of NASA science, offering avenues to connect increased funding to her stated priorities.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching specific examples of how the University of Iowa's substantial NASA science contracts, particularly in heliophysics, directly benefit Iowa's economy, create jobs, or inspire local students in STEM fields.</li>
<li>Explore gathering personal stories from Iowans—students, educators, or small business owners involved in NASA science-related projects—to illustrate the tangible impact of these investments on career development and local innovation.</li>
<li>Look into preparing concise arguments that demonstrate the return on investment of NASA's space science activities, highlighting how these programs contribute to U.S. competitiveness, national security, and technological advancement without wasteful spending.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Joni Ernst</h2>
<ul>
<li>Bachelor's degree in psychology from Iowa State University (1992).</li>
<li>Master of Public Administration from Columbus State University (1995).</li>
<li>Served 23 years in the U.S. Army Reserve and Iowa Army National Guard.</li>
<li>Retired as a lieutenant colonel; commanded units during Iraq War.</li>
<li>Previously served as Montgomery County Auditor and Iowa State Senator.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local NASA Research Investment:</strong> The University of Iowa in her state receives substantial NASA contracts and grants for heliophysics missions and general science programs, demonstrating a direct local economic and research interest in NASA science activities. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for STEM Education:</strong> Senator Ernst has actively promoted STEM education, co-leading the bipartisan National STEM Week Act to strengthen the workforce pipeline in science and technology fields. (Senator Joni Ernst Press Release, 2025-03)</li>
<li><strong>Support for Small Business Innovation Programs:</strong> As Chair of the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee, Senator Ernst champions the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs, which NASA utilizes to advance promising technologies from research to production, explicitly mentioning "scientists" as beneficiaries. (FedScoop, 2025-03; Senator Joni Ernst Press Release, 2025-09)</li>
<li><strong>Engagement in Space Technology for National Security:</strong> Senator Ernst co-introduced the bipartisan Space Technology and Regional Security (STARS) Act, indicating an understanding of and interest in space capabilities and technology, albeit with a national security focus. (Senator Joni Ernst Press Release, 2024-06)</li>
<li><strong>General Emphasis on Domestic R&amp;D and Innovation:</strong> She advocates for surging investments into domestic research and development and technology to maintain U.S. competitiveness and national security, a stance that aligns with the goals of NASA's science and exploration programs. (Forbes Breaking News, 2025-07)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Senator Ernst consistently advocates for reducing government spending and eliminating waste, evidenced by her founding of the Senate Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) Caucus and efforts to expose "boondoggles" (Politico Pro, 2024-11; Ernst Press Release, 2025-08).</li>
<li><strong>Direct Criticism of NASA Exploration Costs:</strong> Senator Ernst recently identified NASA's Artemis moon mission launch booster and engine contracts as a "boondoggle" due to being $6 billion over budget in an official report on government waste (Ernst Press Release, 2025-08).</li>
<li><strong>Skepticism on Climate Science:</strong> Senator Ernst has previously expressed skepticism regarding human-caused climate change and has supported actions to eliminate energy-efficient credits and attack climate-related funds (Inside Climate News, 2020-09; Bleeding Heartland, 2025-09).</li>
<li><strong>Focus on National Security Space:</strong> Senator Ernst's recent legislative engagement with space policy has centered on national security concerns, such as introducing the bipartisan STARS Act to counter Iranian space threats (Ernst Press Release, 2024-06).</li>
<li><strong>Absence from Space-Related Committees:</strong> Senator Ernst does not hold any current assignments on Senate committees with direct jurisdiction over civil space policy or NASA's budget, as per authoritative committee data.</li>
