    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.

<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Appropriations</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Simpson's strong emphasis on fiscal conservatism and his dedication to securing funding for nuclear energy and the Idaho National Laboratory present significant challenges to advocating for increased NASA space science funding. His support for broader nondefense spending cuts and nuanced views on climate change policy may also make him hesitant to champion substantial budget growth for certain science initiatives.</p>
<p>However, as a member of the House Appropriations Committee, Representative Simpson is in a key position to influence NASA's budget and has previously supported robust federal research and development. Crucially, his district directly benefits from over $5 million in NASA Science Mission Directorate grants to Boise State University for STEM, Earth, and planetary science, providing a strong local connection and potential point of leverage for advocates. His past vote to maintain planetary science funding further indicates a possible receptiveness to specific science divisions.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider gathering specific examples of how NASA science grants to Boise State University have directly benefited Idaho, such as student opportunities, local research outcomes, or contributions to understanding Idaho's natural resources.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's science investments, particularly those with direct local impact or contributing to national priorities, align with Representative Simpson's emphasis on fiscal responsibility and effective use of federal R&amp;D funding.</li>
<li>Look into how NASA Earth science data and research, such as the snow-water-equivalent measurements funded at Boise State, provide critical information for managing Idaho's natural resources and water supply, aligning with his recognition of climate change's impact on the state.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Michael K. Simpson</h2>
<ul>
<li>Holds a Doctor of Dental Medicine (DMD) degree from Washington University in St. Louis.</li>
<li>Practiced dentistry in Blackfoot, Idaho, for over two decades before entering Congress.</li>
<li>Served as Speaker of the Idaho House of Representatives from 1992 to 1998.</li>
<li>Strong advocate for nuclear power, overseeing Idaho National Laboratory research.</li>
<li>Recognizes climate change as a reality, linking it to Idaho's natural resources.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Appropriations Committee Role:</strong> As a Member of the House Committee on Appropriations, Representative Simpson is in a key position to influence NASA's budget and has supported robust funding for federal science agencies, including NASA's Science Mission Directorate. (The Hill, 2024-07)</li>
<li><strong>Direct Local NASA Science Investment:</strong> Boise State University in his district has received over $5 million in NASA Science Mission Directorate grants for STEM engagement, Earth science, and planetary science research, demonstrating a direct local benefit from these activities. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Support for Federal Research and Development:</strong> Representative Simpson has highlighted the importance of federal investments in research and development, including NASA's science programs, during House Appropriations Committee hearings. (House Appropriations Committee Press Release, 2024-05)</li>
<li><strong>Specific Vote on Planetary Science:</strong> During a recent Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies appropriations bill markup, Representative Simpson voted in favor of an amendment that maintained funding levels for NASA's planetary science division. (Congressional Record, 2024-07)</li>
<li><strong>Recognition of Climate Change:</strong> Representative Simpson recognizes climate change as a reality, linking it to Idaho's natural resources, which aligns with the objectives of NASA's Earth science research. (Idaho Statesman, 2023-11)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competing Priorities (Nuclear Energy):</strong> Representative Simpson, a Member of the House Committee on Appropriations, actively champions nuclear energy and the Idaho National Laboratory, securing significant funding in recent appropriations bills, which may lead to a prioritization of these investments over broader NASA science activities.</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Representative Simpson consistently emphasizes addressing the national debt and advocates for fiscal responsibility, supporting legislation like the Fiscal Responsibility Act (2023-05-31) that included nondefense spending cuts, indicating a general predisposition against increasing federal expenditures.</li>
<li><strong>Skepticism on Climate Change Policy:</strong> While acknowledging climate change, Representative Simpson's public statements express disagreement on the magnitude of human influence and opposition to certain environmental regulations, potentially translating to less robust support for specific aspects of NASA's Earth Science mission.</li>
