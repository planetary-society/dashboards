    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.
    All AI-generated claims, assessments, and recommendations should be independently verified.
    This is an experimental feature, and intended to provide guidance and inspiration for outreach strategies for your meeting. Feedback is welcome: casey.dreier@planetary.org.

<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Kelly's background suggests a foundational appreciation for science, evidenced by her past service on the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee and consistent advocacy for STEM education. Her engagement with the Commerce, Justice, Science appropriations process indicates familiarity with the funding mechanisms relevant to NASA, and the significant NASA research investment in the University of Illinois system could be a point of connection for broader state-level support for scientific endeavors.</p>
<p>However, her current lack of space-related committee assignments and the absence of direct NASA Science Mission Directorate contracts or grants within her district suggest limited direct incentive to champion increased space science funding. Her legislative priorities are focused on other areas, and her ongoing Senate campaign emphasizes different policy issues, making it less likely that space science will be a primary focus. Advocates may find receptiveness to the general value of science and STEM, but direct advocacy for specific NASA science budget increases may face an uphill battle given her competing priorities and lack of direct district economic ties to the issue.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider how increased investment in NASA's space science activities directly supports and expands STEM education opportunities, particularly for underserved communities, aligning with Representative Kelly's consistent advocacy for STEM.</li>
<li>Explore the broader economic and scientific impact of the University of Illinois Chicago's recent NASA grant for in-space manufacturing, demonstrating how NASA science investment benefits Illinois and fosters innovation.</li>
<li>Look into how NASA's scientific research, especially in areas like Earth observation or advanced materials, contributes to broader societal benefits that may resonate with her interests in public health, environmental protection, or technological advancement.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Robin L. Kelly</h2>
<ul>
<li>Holds a BA in psychology, MA in counseling, and PhD in political science.</li>
<li>Early career included directing a crisis nursery and hospital work.</li>
<li>Served in the Illinois House of Representatives from 2003 to 2007.</li>
<li>Was Chief of Staff for Illinois Treasurer and Cook County Chief Administrative Officer.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>STEM Education Advocacy:</strong> Representative Kelly consistently advocates for expanding Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education, viewing it as crucial for innovation and future careers, and has included STEM initiatives in her FY2023 and FY2022 Community Project Funding requests. This aligns with NASA's long-term workforce development goals. (House.gov, N/A)</li>
<li><strong>Engagement with Science Appropriations:</strong> Representative Kelly submitted community projects for funding in the FY2026 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill, which typically includes NASA's budget. This indicates active participation in the federal funding process relevant to science agencies. (House.gov, N/A)</li>
<li><strong>Support for Local NASA-Related Research:</strong> The University of Illinois Chicago (UIC), within Illinois, recently received a $4.65 million NASA grant to establish a center for in-space manufacturing, focusing on recycling and regolith processing for sustainable space exploration. This demonstrates significant NASA investment in Illinois research institutions. (University of Illinois Chicago, 2024-10)</li>
<li><strong>Expressed Value for Scientific Research:</strong> While not a current committee assignment, Representative Kelly previously served on the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee and has expressed a strong belief in the importance of scientific research, noting concern when colleagues did not believe in science. This suggests a foundational appreciation for scientific endeavors. (MATTER Chicago, 2018-11)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>No Space-Related Committee Assignments:</strong> Representative Kelly does not hold any current space-related committee assignments in the 119th Congress, which may limit her direct legislative influence on NASA programs. (Authoritative Committee Data)</li>
<li><strong>Absence of District NASA Economic Ties:</strong> No relevant NASA Science Mission Directorate contracts or grants were found for Illinois's 2nd Congressional District, indicating a lack of direct economic incentive for her to champion NASA science. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Prioritization of Other Policy Areas:</strong> Her official legislative priorities prominently feature healthcare, gun violence prevention, cybersecurity, and environmental issues, suggesting space science may not be a primary focus. (House.gov, 2025)</li>
<li><strong>Limited Public Advocacy for Space Science:</strong> Public records from the last 24 months do not show significant statements or legislative actions by Representative Kelly specifically advocating for increased investment in NASA's space science activities or exploration programs. (No public record found)</li>
<li><strong>Focus on 2026 Senate Campaign:</strong> Representative Kelly has announced her candidacy for the U.S. Senate in 2026, with her public campaign statements emphasizing issues such as gun violence prevention, healthcare, and countering political opposition, rather than space policy. (WTTW, 2025-05; IPM Newsroom, 2025-07)</li>
