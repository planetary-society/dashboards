    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.
    All AI-generated claims, assessments, and recommendations should be independently verified.

<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Krishnamoorthi's lack of direct committee assignments related to NASA and his primary focus as Ranking Member on the Select Committee on Strategic Competition with China suggest that specific NASA science funding may not be a top legislative priority. While his district benefits from some NASA Science Mission Directorate contracts, their modest total value over the past three years may not provide a strong economic incentive to prioritize substantial budget increases amidst his broad domestic agenda.</p>
<p>However, his background in mechanical engineering and experience in high-tech businesses indicate an appreciation for scientific R&amp;D and a skilled workforce, which are critical to NASA's mission. His past support for geospatial intelligence and advocacy for high-skilled workers align with the broader goals of space science. Advocates can leverage these points, along with the local, albeit small, contributions to planetary science and bioscience research, to highlight the value of NASA's scientific endeavors.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching how NASA's space science activities, particularly in areas like advanced technology development and Earth observation, contribute to U.S. technological leadership and national security, aligning with his work on strategic competition.</li>
<li>Explore how the existing NASA science contracts in his district, even if modest, support local high-tech jobs, foster STEM education, or contribute to the skilled workforce development he has championed.</li>
<li>Look into specific NASA science missions or research initiatives that directly align with his mechanical engineering background, experience in high-tech small businesses, or legislative interest in geospatial intelligence.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Raja Krishnamoorthi</h2>
<ul>
<li>Earned a Bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from Princeton University.</li>
<li>Received a Juris Doctor with honors from Harvard Law School.</li>
<li>Served as president of high-tech small businesses in the Chicago area.</li>
<li>Authored bills supporting microelectronics R&amp;D and geospatial intelligence.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Technical Background:</strong> Representative Krishnamoorthi's background includes a Bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering and experience as president of high-tech small businesses, indicating an understanding and appreciation for scientific and technological advancement. (Biography)</li>
<li><strong>Local NASA Science Contracts:</strong> Companies in his district, such as Fisher Scientific Company LLC in Hanover Park, IL, and PHC Corporation of North America in Wood Dale, IL, have received NASA contracts for equipment supporting planetary science (astrobiology) and bioscience research. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Support for Workforce Development:</strong> In June 2025, Representative Krishnamoorthi re-introduced a resolution to double federal funding for career and technical education, emphasizing the importance of equipping workers with in-demand skills and investing in the workforce for a stronger economy. (Representative Krishnamoorthi, 2025-06-04)</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for High-Skilled Workers:</strong> In September 2025, he described a proposed H-1B visa fee hike as a "reckless attempt to cut America off from high-skilled workers who have long strengthened our workforce, fuelled innovation, and helped build industries that employ millions of Americans." (ET Now, 2025-09-20)</li>
<li><strong>Interest in Geospatial Intelligence:</strong> His legislative record includes authoring bills that support geospatial intelligence research and development, demonstrating an interest in space-derived data and its applications for national benefit. (Biography)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>No Space-Related Committee Assignments:</strong> Representative Krishnamoorthi does not hold any current assignments on committees with direct jurisdiction over NASA's budget or space policy, limiting his direct legislative influence on space science funding. (Authoritative Committee Data)</li>
<li><strong>Primary Focus on China Competition:</strong> As the Ranking Member of the House Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party, his legislative and oversight efforts are primarily directed towards national security, economic, and technological competition with China, which may divert focus from specific NASA science advocacy.</li>
<li><strong>Broad Competing Domestic Priorities:</strong> Representative Krishnamoorthi's stated legislative priorities and recent activities encompass a wide array of domestic issues, including economic growth, job creation, environmental protection, education, healthcare, and social safety net programs, which could compete for his attention and support for federal funding.</li>
<li><strong>Modest Local NASA SMD Economic Impact:</strong> While his district has received some NASA Science Mission Directorate contracts, their relatively small total value may not provide a significant economic incentive to prioritize substantial increases in NASA science and exploration funding over other district needs. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
