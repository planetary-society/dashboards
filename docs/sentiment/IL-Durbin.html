<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, Senate Committee on Appropriations</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Senator Durbin has demonstrated support for federal scientific research, including space science, and has actively worked to protect NASA's Science Mission Directorate from budget cuts as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. The significant NASA science grants awarded to Illinois institutions, particularly the University of Chicago and the University of Illinois for astrophysics and planetary science projects, provide a strong local connection and economic incentive for his continued engagement.</p>
<p>However, Senator Durbin's advocacy is often heavily focused on biomedical research, and his broad appropriations role means NASA science competes with many other state priorities. While he has been instrumental in maintaining current funding levels, there is no clear public record of him pushing for substantial <em>growth</em> in NASA science, which is critical in light of the proposed FY2026 budget cuts. Advocates should emphasize the direct local benefits and the strategic importance of <em>increased</em> investment to overcome these competing interests and move beyond just defending the status quo.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider preparing specific examples and personal stories from Illinois residents, researchers, or students directly benefiting from the NASA science grants at the University of Illinois and the University of Chicago, such as those involved in GLIDE, STARFIRE, PUEO, or HELIX.</li>
<li>Explore how increased investment in NASA's science mission aligns with Senator Durbin's stated commitment to federal research funding for economic growth and national competitiveness, perhaps by highlighting workforce development or technological innovation in Illinois.</li>
<li>Look into how a modest increase in NASA's Science Mission Directorate budget could yield significant returns for scientific discovery, technological advancement, and inspire the next generation of STEM workforce, building on his record of protecting science agency investments.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Richard J. Durbin</h2>
<ul>
<li>Graduated from Georgetown University Law Center (J.D. 1969) and School of Foreign Service (B.S. 1966).</li>
<li>Practiced law, serving as legal counsel for Illinois Lieutenant Governor and State Senate.</li>
<li>Co-owned a pub and was an adjunct professor of medical law.</li>
<li>No military service or direct space/science industry ties found in biography.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Support for NASA Science Appropriations:</strong> As a Member of the Senate Committee on Appropriations, Senator Durbin voted for the FY2024 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies appropriations bill, which included robust funding for NASA's Science Mission Directorate. This action directly supports program growth and rejects cuts to NASA science. (Senate Appropriations Committee, 2023-07)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Advocacy for Federal Research Funding:</strong> Senator Durbin has publicly emphasized the importance of federal investment in scientific research for economic growth and national competitiveness, specifically mentioning space science as a critical area. This general support for science funding creates a favorable environment for increased NASA science investment. (Chicago Tribune, 2024-03)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Protection of Science Agency Investments:</strong> Senator Durbin has highlighted the need to protect investments in non-defense discretionary spending, including science agencies like NASA, to avoid long-term damage to research capabilities, indicating a posture against cuts to science budgets. (Congressional Record, 2024-09)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Local University Research Support:</strong> Senator Durbin announced federal funding for space-related research at the University of Illinois, which has received significant NASA grants for projects like GLIDE and STARFIRE, demonstrating a local connection to and support for NASA's science activities. (Durbin.Senate.gov, 2023-10; USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support for Illinois-based Astrophysics Research:</strong> The University of Chicago, located in Illinois, has received substantial NASA grants for astrophysics projects such as PUEO and HELIX, indicating a local interest in and benefit from NASA's science mission, which Senator Durbin's office has acknowledged through general support for federal research funding. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Primary Focus on Biomedical Research:</strong> Senator Durbin has recently expressed strong "personal disappointment" regarding proposed cuts to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and has consistently advocated for increased biomedical research funding (Forbes Breaking News, 2025-06-10; CBS News, 2025-06-10). This indicates a significant allocation of his advocacy efforts towards health-related science, which may limit his capacity to champion substantial growth in other science domains like space science.</li>
<li><strong>Broad Appropriations Committee Responsibilities:</strong> As a member of the Senate Committee on Appropriations, Senator Durbin manages a wide range of federal spending priorities, securing funding for diverse Illinois projects in areas such as health, education, and defense (U.S. Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois, 2025-08-01; U.S. Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois, 2024-08-02). This extensive portfolio means NASA science is one among many competing interests for his attention and advocacy, particularly during constrained budget environments.</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on Climate Change Initiatives:</strong> Senator Durbin has actively championed legislation like the America's Clean Future Fund Act and the Climate Change Resiliency Fund for America Act, demonstrating a strong focus on climate change mitigation and resilience (U.S. Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois, 2025-09-04; U.S. Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois, 2025-07-22). While Earth science is a component of NASA's Science Mission Directorate, this specific emphasis might prioritize climate-related Earth science over other space science disciplines.</li>
<li><strong>Defense of Status Quo Funding for NASA Science:</strong> While Senator Durbin, through his role on the Senate Appropriations Committee, has been instrumental in rejecting proposed cuts to NASA science and ensuring funding remains at FY2025 levels (The Planetary Society, 2025-09-17), there is no explicit recent public record indicating a strong push for significant <em>growth</em> in NASA's Science Mission Directorate beyond maintaining current levels.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Direct Space/Science Industry Background:</strong> Senator Durbin's professional background is primarily in law and politics, with no direct prior experience in the space or science industry (Biography). This lack of a personal connection to the field might mean his engagement with NASA science is more driven by local economic benefits and broader policy goals rather than an inherent passion for space exploration or scientific discovery.</li>
