<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Appropriations</li>
<li>Member, House Committee on Appropriations: Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Mrvan's position on the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies provides a direct and critical opportunity for advocacy regarding NASA's budget. His past support for STEM education, demonstrated by securing funding for the Challenger Learning Center, indicates a positive view of space-related educational initiatives. Moreover, his general opposition to funding cuts that might impact economic development suggests he could be receptive to arguments about the broader economic and technological benefits of robust NASA science.</p>
<p>However, a significant challenge is the complete absence of NASA Science Mission Directorate contracts or grants within his district, which means there is no direct local economic incentive for increased funding. His public statements and priorities within the Appropriations Subcommittee often emphasize other agencies and local social programs, and he has not explicitly advocated for increased NASA science investment. Advocates will need to frame the discussion around the national benefits of space science, connecting it to broader economic growth, technological innovation, and educational opportunities that could indirectly benefit his constituents, rather than focusing on direct district-specific gains.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider highlighting the success of the Challenger Learning Center of Northwest Indiana, which Representative Mrvan supported, and connect increased NASA science investment to inspiring and preparing the next generation of scientists and engineers from his district for future high-tech careers.</li>
<li>Explore how robust NASA science funding, while not currently tied to direct local contracts, contributes to national innovation and economic growth that could attract related industries or foster a skilled workforce in Northwest Indiana over time.</li>
<li>Look into framing increased NASA science investment as a strategic federal allocation that supports U.S. global leadership in science and technology, aligning with his Appropriations Subcommittee role and his general opposition to funding cuts that undermine national interests.</li>
</ul>

(Representative Frank Mrvan - House.gov, 2024-07-30)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Focus on Economic Development:</strong> Mrvan consistently emphasizes federal funding for economic development and job creation in Northwest Indiana, a priority that aligns with the economic benefits often generated by NASA contracts and research investments. (House.gov, 2025-01-13, 2024-07-02)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bipartisan Collaboration on Science/Technology:</strong> He has expressed a desire for bipartisan cooperation on funding measures and collaborated with a Republican Senator on a hydrogen hub project, suggesting openness to cross-party efforts for scientific and technological initiatives. (House.gov, 2024-07-02; YouTube, 2025-05-08)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Opposition to Funding Cuts:</strong> Mrvan voted against a full-year continuing resolution due to concerns it would "strip away specific funding" for public safety and economic development, indicating a general reluctance to support cuts perceived as detrimental to his district and national interests. (House.gov, 2025-03-24)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of local NASA-related economic ties:</strong> No relevant NASA Science Mission Directorate contracts or grants were found for Indiana's 1st congressional district. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Competing priorities within Appropriations CJS Subcommittee:</strong> As a member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies, Representative Mrvan's stated priorities within this role emphasize the International Trade Commission, Department of Commerce, and Department of Justice, without explicit mention of NASA as a primary focus.</li>
<li><strong>Strong focus on local economic development and social programs:</strong> Representative Mrvan's public statements and votes frequently highlight securing funding for local jobs, healthcare, and public safety initiatives within his district.</li>
<li><strong>Limited explicit public advocacy for increased NASA science/exploration:</strong> Public records do not show recent explicit statements or actions by Representative Mrvan specifically advocating for increased investment in NASA's science or exploration programs.</li>
