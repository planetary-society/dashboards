<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Stutzman's strong fiscal conservative record, including past votes to reduce government spending and a focus on budget matters, suggests he may be skeptical of calls for increased federal investment, particularly in light of the proposed 47% cut to NASA's Science Mission Directorate. His district also lacks significant direct NASA Science contracts or grants, removing a key economic incentive for his support. Furthermore, his current committee assignments do not place him in a position of direct influence over space policy or NASA's budget.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, there are potential avenues for engagement. Representative Stutzman has expressed appreciation for "ingenuity and innovation" and described research and development as a "helpful, useful tool." His past support for alternative energy research and engagement with Purdue University Fort Wayne, which hosts a NASA-affiliated Space Grant Consortium, indicate an understanding of the value of scientific and technological advancement and local STEM connections. Advocates could frame increased NASA science funding as a strategic investment in innovation, R&amp;D, and workforce development that benefits the nation, rather than solely as increased spending.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider highlighting how NASA science investments directly support STEM education and workforce development at Purdue University Fort Wayne, a local institution he has engaged with, fostering innovation and preparing students for future careers in his district.</li>
<li>Explore connecting NASA's scientific research to broader innovation and technological advancements that could benefit Indiana's economy or agricultural sector, aligning with his appreciation for R&amp;D and interest in science-related consumer issues.</li>
<li>Look into framing NASA science funding as a strategic investment in foundational research that drives long-term economic growth and national competitiveness, appealing to his interest in business and innovation despite fiscal conservative leanings.</li>
