    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.

<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Spartz's strong fiscal conservatism and consistent calls for federal spending cuts present a significant challenge to advocating for increased NASA space science funding. Her lack of direct space-related committee assignments and minimal local NASA economic ties, evidenced by only one small, indirect contract in her district, suggest that space policy may not be a primary focus. Additionally, her skepticism toward climate-related government spending could make her unreceptive to NASA's Earth Science initiatives.</p>
<p>However, there is potential for engagement given her demonstrated support for STEM education, including hosting the Congressional App Challenge and engaging with local aerospace and robotics initiatives. Advocates could highlight how NASA science investments drive innovation, foster critical STEM skills, and inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers, connecting these benefits to her interest in local educational and technological development, rather than focusing solely on budget increases.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching specific examples of how NASA science missions inspire students in Indiana's 5th district, particularly those involved in STEM programs or the Congressional App Challenge, to demonstrate local impact on future workforce development.</li>
<li>Explore data on the economic return on investment from NASA science, including technological spin-offs and job creation, to align with her fiscal conservative principles and background as a CPA and CFO.</li>
<li>Look into how local companies like NearSpace Launch or organizations involved with FIRST Robotics in her district could indirectly benefit from or be inspired by NASA's scientific advancements, even without direct contracts.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Victoria Spartz</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ukrainian-born, immigrated to the U.S. in 2000, became a citizen in 2006.</li>
<li>Holds a Bachelor of Science and MBA from Kyiv National Economic University.</li>
<li>Earned a Master of Accountancy from Indiana University â€“ Purdue University Indianapolis.</li>
<li>Worked as a Certified Public Accountant and adjunct faculty at Kelley School of Business.</li>
<li>Served as CFO for the Indiana Attorney General's office and as an Indiana State Senator.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Promotes STEM through Congressional App Challenge:</strong> Representative Spartz hosted the 2024 Congressional App Challenge, encouraging middle and high school students in her district to learn coding and pursue computer science careers, with the winning app addressing local environmental issues. (StreamE wins Rep. Victoria Spartz's 2024 Congressional App Challenge in Indiana's Fifth District, 2025-01)</li>
<li><strong>Engages with local aerospace and STEM education initiatives:</strong> In 2021, Representative Spartz met with NearSpace Launch, an aviation and aerospace company in Upland, IN, which expands STEM education through its "Your Steps to Space for Students" program, demonstrating engagement with local space-related technology and education. (Congresswoman Spartz Hears from Employers and Entrepreneurs in Grant County, 2021-04)</li>
<li><strong>Supports a broader definition and promotion of STEM education:</strong> Representative Spartz co-sponsored the bipartisan Accounting STEM Pursuit Act in 2021, which aimed to classify accounting as a STEM profession and promote related education, indicating a general appreciation for STEM fields. (Reps. Spartz and Stevens Introduce Bipartisan Accounting STEM Pursuit Act, 2021-06)</li>
<li><strong>Local support for robotics and STEM programs:</strong> A contract was awarded to Andymark Inc. in Kokomo, IN, for "Andymark frc field perimeter" between FY2022 and FY2024, indicating local involvement in FIRST Robotics Competition, a program that aligns with STEM education. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strong Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Representative Spartz consistently advocates for significant cuts to federal spending and balancing the budget, expressing concerns about the national debt and criticizing "unnecessary spending". This stance suggests potential resistance to increasing NASA's budget.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Direct Space Policy Focus:</strong> Representative Spartz has no current space-related committee assignments in the 119th Congress, and her public statements and official website prioritize other issues such as healthcare, immigration, and national defense, without specific mention of NASA or space science.</li>
<li><strong>Skepticism Towards Climate-Related Government Spending:</strong> Her voting record indicates opposition to measures related to climate and environmental protection, such as "Repealing Actions on Climate and Environmental Justice," which could extend to skepticism or opposition to NASA's Earth Science activities.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Direct Local NASA Economic Ties:</strong> The provided contract data shows only one small, indirectly related contract ($29K to Andymark Inc. for "frc field perimeter") in her district, with no other relevant awards found for direct NASA Science Mission Directorate or exploration-related economic activity (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024).</li>
