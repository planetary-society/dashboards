<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Shreve's strong fiscal conservative stance and emphasis on reducing federal spending pose a significant challenge for advocating increased NASA space science funding, particularly given the proposed deep cuts. The absence of direct NASA Science Mission Directorate contracts or grants within his district also means there isn't a clear local economic tie-in to leverage, and he does not hold a committee assignment directly overseeing NASA.</p>
<p>However, his academic ties to Purdue University and the Indiana University system, both with NASA connections, offer potential points of receptiveness. Advocates could frame increased NASA science investment as a driver for digital innovation, STEM workforce development, and long-term economic growth, aligning with his stated priorities. His co-sponsorship of National Space Day further suggests a general positive disposition toward space activities.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching specific NASA-funded science projects or STEM initiatives at Purdue University or within the Indiana University system that benefit students or faculty from Indiana, highlighting the intellectual capital and workforce development aspects.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's space science activities, even without direct district contracts, drive national economic development, foster digital innovation, and maintain U.S. competitiveness in critical high-tech sectors, aligning with his business background and priorities.</li>
<li>Look into how NASA's foundational space science investments contribute to national security, inspire future generations in STEM, and provide long-term societal benefits that align with the spirit of National Space Day and a vision for American leadership.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Purdue University Affiliation:</strong> Representative Shreve earned an MBA from Purdue University, a prominent institution with strong ties to NASA and aerospace, which hosts the Indiana Space Grant Consortium that receives NASA funding for STEM education and research, including planetary science. (Purdue University, 2021-06)</li>
<li><strong>Support for National Space Day:</strong> He co-sponsored a resolution commemorating May 2, 2025, as National Space Day, indicating a general positive stance toward space activities and their national importance. (Congress.gov, 2025-05)</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on Economic Development and Digital Innovation:</strong> Representative Shreve's legislative priorities include leveraging business experience for economic development in his district and making the U.S. a leader in digital innovation, areas often advanced by NASA's scientific and technological endeavors. (House.gov, 2025-01)</li>
<li><strong>Indiana University System Connections:</strong> His strong ties to Indiana University, including service on the IU Indianapolis Chancellor's Board, connect him to a university system that conducts scientific research and contributes to the state's intellectual capital. (Rotary Club of Indianapolis, 2023-10)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of Space-Related Committee Assignment:</strong> Representative Shreve does not hold any current assignments on committees directly overseeing NASA or space policy, such as the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee. (Authoritative Committee Data, 2025-01)</li>
<li><strong>Strong Fiscal Conservative Stance:</strong> Representative Shreve has consistently prioritized reining in federal spending and reducing the national debt, voting for a GOP budget blueprint that included $2 trillion in spending cuts and emphasizing "right-sizing our federal bureaucracy". (House.gov, 2025-01; The Republic News, 2025-02; Representative Jefferson Shreve, 2025-05)</li>
<li><strong>Absence of Direct NASA Economic Ties:</strong> There are no public records of significant NASA Science Mission Directorate contracts or grants awarded within Representative Shreve's 6th Congressional District. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Prioritization of Other Legislative Issues:</strong> Representative Shreve's public statements and sponsored legislation primarily focus on economic development, border security, energy costs, and conservative values, with less emphasis on space science or exploration. (House.gov, 2025-01; Representative Jefferson Shreve, 2025-01; WFYI, 2024-11; YouTube, 2024-10)</li>
<li><strong>Limited Public Advocacy for NASA Science Growth:</strong> While co-sponsoring bills like the NASA Talent Exchange Program Act and the DOE and NASA Interagency Research Coordination Act, Representative Shreve has not made prominent public statements or press releases specifically advocating for increased investment in NASA's science activities or exploration programs. (Congress.gov, 2025-09; Congress.gov, 2025-02; House.gov, 2025-09)</li>
