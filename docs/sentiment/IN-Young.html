<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Senator Young's consistent focus on fiscal conservatism and concerns about federal spending present a significant challenge for advocating increased NASA science funding, particularly given the proposed 47% cut for FY26. His emphasis on national security and economic competitiveness may require advocates to carefully align pure science initiatives with these priorities, and Earth science programs could face scrutiny due to his preference for technological solutions over regulatory approaches.</p>
<p>However, there are strong opportunities for engagement. Senator Young's co-sponsorship of the CHIPS and Science Act and the National Quantum Initiative Reauthorization Act demonstrates a clear commitment to scientific R&amp;D, including at NASA. His past statements expressing concern that large mission cost overruns "came at the expense of many other worthy science missions" suggest a desire to protect the broader science portfolio. Furthermore, Indiana benefits from significant NASA science investments, including Redwire Space Technologies in Greenville for microgravity and life sciences research on the ISS, and substantial grants to Purdue University, offering concrete examples of how NASA science directly impacts his constituents and state economy.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider highlighting specific NASA science activities and contracts in Indiana, such as the microgravity research at Redwire Space Technologies or the grants at Purdue University, to demonstrate the direct economic and scientific benefits to his constituents and align with his advocacy for Indiana's space innovation.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's space science initiatives, particularly in areas like quantum research or advanced materials developed in microgravity, directly contribute to U.S. national security and economic competitiveness, aligning with his co-sponsorship of the CHIPS and Science Act and his role on the National Security Commission on Emerging Biotechnology.</li>
<li>Look into framing increased investment in NASA's diverse science portfolio as a fiscally responsible approach that prevents the need for "difficult choices" and protects "worthy science missions" from being cut due to cost overruns in other areas, echoing his past concerns about the science portfolio.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Todd Young</h2>
<ul>
<li>U.S. Marine Corps veteran; led intelligence for an unmanned aerial vehicle squadron.</li>
<li>Graduated U.S. Naval Academy (B.S. Political Science) and earned an MBA.</li>
<li>Co-sponsored the CHIPS and Science Act, promoting technology research and development.</li>
<li>Appointed to the National Security Commission on Emerging Biotechnology.</li>
<li>Previously worked as a management consultant and adjunct professor of public affairs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>CHIPS and Science Act Co-sponsorship:</strong> Senator Young was a key co-sponsor of the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, which authorized significant investments in scientific research and development across various fields, including those relevant to NASA, and he continues to advocate for its funding. (Nextgov/FCW, 2025-03; Senator Young's website, 2024-03)</li>
<li><strong>Senate Commerce Committee Membership:</strong> As a member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, which has direct oversight of NASA, Senator Young actively participates in hearings and legislative efforts concerning space policy and funding. (YouTube, 2025-09; Congress.gov, 2025-03)</li>
<li><strong>Support for Quantum R&amp;D:</strong> Senator Young co-introduced the National Quantum Initiative Reauthorization Act, which explicitly authorizes $2.7 billion in federal funding for quantum research and development at agencies including NASA. (Senator Young Press Release, 2024-12)</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for Indiana's Space Innovation:</strong> Senator Young has highlighted and supported microgravity research, specifically mentioning Redwire Space Technologies in Greenville, IN, for its work on the International Space Station for life and microgravity sciences. (YouTube, 2025-09; USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Concerns for Science Portfolio Protection:</strong> While expressing concerns about cost overruns in large missions, Senator Young has stated that such overruns "came at the expense of many other worthy science missions" and that NASA has been "forced to make difficult choices in their science portfolio," indicating a desire to protect the broader science portfolio. (YouTube, 2023-04; House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, 2024-03)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Senator Young has consistently expressed concerns about federal spending and the national debt, indicating a potential inclination towards fiscal restraint that could impact support for increased NASA science budgets.</li>
<li><strong>Earth Science Funding Scrutiny:</strong> While acknowledging climate change, Senator Young prioritizes technological innovation over regulatory approaches for environmental issues, which may lead to scrutiny of Earth science programs perceived as primarily supporting climate policy.</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on National Security/Economic Competitiveness:</strong> Senator Young frequently frames federal investment in science and technology, such as the CHIPS and Science Act, through the lens of national security and economic competitiveness, potentially requiring advocates to align NASA science initiatives with these priorities.</li>
