    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.

<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Mann's consistent emphasis on fiscal restraint and reducing federal spending, coupled with his lack of direct committee assignments related to space or science, suggests a challenging environment for advocating for increased NASA science funding. His legislative priorities appear to lie elsewhere, primarily in agriculture, energy, and border security, potentially making NASA science a lower-tier concern. Furthermore, his skepticism towards climate-related policies could make certain Earth science initiatives a difficult sell.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, there are tangible opportunities for engagement. His district benefits from over $2.4 million in NASA science grants to local universities, supporting Earth science and heliophysics research, which demonstrates a direct local economic and scientific impact. His co-sponsorship of the AG RESEARCH Act also indicates a clear understanding of the value of federal research investment, offering a potential avenue to connect NASA science to similar arguments about return on investment and national benefit.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching specific faculty or projects at Kansas State University and the University of Kansas that benefit from NASA science grants, especially those related to agriculture, water resources, or space weather, to highlight local impact and shared institutional pride.</li>
<li>Explore how federal investment in NASA science, particularly the grants received by local universities, generates economic benefits, fosters innovation, or provides a return on investment that aligns with his stated interest in fiscal responsibility and national security.</li>
<li>Look into how NASA's Earth science activities, such as those related to water storage and snow radar development by local institutions, can directly support agricultural resilience, water management, or other infrastructure priorities important to his constituents, framing them beyond climate policy.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Tracey Mann</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fifth-generation Kansan, raised on his family's farm in Quinter.</li>
<li>Worked in agriculture with his family on their farm.</li>
<li>Served as Lieutenant Governor of Kansas from 2018 to 2019.</li>
<li>Former student body president at Kansas State University.</li>
<li>Works as a commercial real estate broker; owns his family farm.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local Earth Science Research Investment:</strong> NASA grants totaling over $2.8 million have been awarded to the University of Kansas and Kansas State University for Earth science research, including cryospheric studies, snow radar development, and hydrology related to the SWOT mission, indicating significant local scientific and economic engagement with NASA's Earth Science Mission Directorate. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Local Heliophysics Research Engagement:</strong> The University of Kansas Center for Research Inc. received a $650,000 NASA grant for the "Agile" project, developing an advanced energetic ion electron telescope to characterize solar, magnetospheric, and cosmic ray particles, directly supporting NASA's heliophysics research program and strategic goals related to the Sun-Earth system. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for Federal Research Investment:</strong> Representative Mann co-introduced the bipartisan AG RESEARCH Act in May 2025, advocating for increased federal investment in land-grant universities for agricultural research, citing a significant return on investment and the importance of research for national security, which suggests an understanding of the value of federal science funding.</li>
<li><strong>Bipartisan Collaboration on Research:</strong> His co-sponsorship of the AG RESEARCH Act with bipartisan and bicameral support demonstrates a willingness to collaborate across the aisle on issues of federal research funding, which could extend to NASA science initiatives.</li>
<li><strong>Ties to Research Institutions:</strong> As an alumnus and former student body president of Kansas State University, Representative Mann has a direct connection to a major research institution in his district that receives NASA science grants, potentially fostering a positive view of academic research.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of Direct Legislative Platform:</strong> Representative Mann holds no current committee assignments related to space or science in the 119th Congress, which may limit his direct engagement with NASA's Science Mission Directorate activities. (Authoritative Committee Data)</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on Fiscal Restraint:</strong> Representative Mann has consistently advocated for reducing the national debt, controlling federal spending, and balancing the budget, indicating a potential reluctance to support increased discretionary spending for NASA science.</li>
<li><strong>Dominance of Other Legislative Priorities:</strong> His public record highlights a strong focus on agriculture, energy independence, transportation infrastructure, veterans' affairs, and border security, suggesting that NASA science may not be among his primary legislative concerns.</li>
<li><strong>Skepticism towards Climate-Related Policies:</strong> Representative Mann has expressed opposition to the "Green New Deal agenda" and advocated for rolling back regulations on energy production, which could translate to a cautious stance on certain Earth science initiatives perceived as linked to climate policy.</li>
