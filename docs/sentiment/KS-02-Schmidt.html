    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.
    All AI-generated claims, assessments, and recommendations should be independently verified.

<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Schmidt's strong fiscal conservative background and lack of direct committee assignments related to space policy suggest he may be cautious about increasing federal discretionary spending, particularly given the proposed significant cuts to NASA's Science Mission Directorate. While his district does not host direct NASA science research grants, this could limit his immediate receptiveness to arguments based solely on local scientific economic impact.</p>
<p>However, there are tangible local connections to NASA through a $5.4 million contract in Kansas City for logistical support to disseminate scientific and technical information, which is vital to the overall science mission. Furthermore, his alma mater and other state universities benefit from NASA Space Grant funding for student programs and research infrastructure, including CubeSat projects. These existing ties, coupled with his general support for constituents seeking federal grants and interest in small business technology procurement, offer potential avenues to advocate for the broader value of NASA's science investments.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Explore how the Tom &amp; Jerry Inc. contract in Kansas City, while focused on logistical support, directly contributes to the dissemination of NASA's scientific and technical information, demonstrating a local connection to the broader value of NASA's science mission.</li>
<li>Consider how NASA's Space Grant Consortium, which includes his alma mater, the University of Kansas, directly supports student programs and research infrastructure in Kansas, and how increased science investment can expand these local educational and workforce development opportunities.</li>
<li>Look into how NASA science investments, framed as a long-term federal investment, align with principles of fiscal responsibility by fostering innovation and creating opportunities for Kansas entities to secure federal grants, consistent with his office's support for constituent grant-seeking.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Derek Schmidt</h2>
<ul>
<li>Holds a bachelor's degree from the University of Kansas and a J.D. from Georgetown Law.</li>
<li>Earned a master's degree in international politics from the University of Leicester.</li>
<li>Served as a legislative assistant for U.S. Senator Nancy Kassebaum.</li>
<li>Previously served as Kansas State Senator, including as Senate Majority Leader.</li>
<li>Served three terms as the Kansas Attorney General from 2011 to 2023.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Direct Local NASA Contract:</strong> A company in Representative Schmidt's district, Tom &amp; Jerry Inc. in Kansas City, KS, received a $5.4 million NASA contract for logistical and management support to disseminate administrative, scientific, and technical information. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>State-wide NASA Research and Education:</strong> Kansas universities, including the University of Kansas (Rep. Schmidt's alma mater) and Kansas State University, are part of the Kansas Space Grant Consortium, which receives NASA funding for student programs and research infrastructure, including recent CubeSat projects. (K-State Funding Connection, 2023-03-29; NASA, 2024)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Constituent Grant Support:</strong> Representative Schmidt's official House website provides resources and guidance for constituents seeking federal grants, indicating a general willingness to assist local entities in securing federal funding opportunities. (Representative Derek Schmidt - House.gov, undated)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Small Business and Technology Procurement:</strong> He recently supported legislation to streamline the process for small businesses to compete for Department of Defense contracts, demonstrating an interest in fostering technological innovation and economic opportunity through federal procurement. (U.S. House passes Rep. Derek Schmidt legislation..., 2025-09-11)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of Direct Local Economic Ties to NASA Science:</strong> The provided contract data indicates no direct NASA Science Mission Directorate grants or contracts for science activities in Kansas's 2nd congressional district, suggesting limited local economic benefit from NASA science investments. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>General Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> As a Republican, Representative Schmidt's political background, including his tenure as Kansas Attorney General and gubernatorial campaign, has consistently emphasized fiscal responsibility and reduced government spending, which could lead to scrutiny of federal discretionary spending, including NASA's science budget. (Kansas Reflector, 2022-10)</li>
<li><strong>No Direct Space-Related Committee Assignments:</strong> Representative Schmidt holds no current space-related committee assignments in the 119th Congress, which may limit his direct engagement and influence on NASA's budget and policy decisions. (space_committees, 2025-09)</li>
<li><strong>Focus on State-Level Priorities:</strong> Public statements and policy positions from Representative Schmidt's prior roles, such as his 2022 gubernatorial campaign, primarily focused on state-level issues like the Kansas budget, tax policy, crime, and education, potentially indicating a prioritization of state concerns over federal discretionary spending on science. (Kansas Reflector, 2022-10)</li>
