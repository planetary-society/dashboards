<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Appropriations</li>
<li>Chair, House Committee on Appropriations: Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Rogers, as Chair of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies, is a critical decision-maker for NASA's budget and has shown a willingness to protect the agency's funding. He notably rejected a proposed $6 billion cut to NASA in the FY2026 budget, maintaining FY2025 levels, and has emphasized the importance of U.S. leadership in space and scientific research. His district also benefits from a NASA contract with Morehead State University for lunar-related science support, which he has highlighted.</p>
<p>However, advocates should be prepared to connect increased science investments to national competitiveness and NASA's "core mission," given his focus on fiscal responsibility and overall discretionary spending reductions. While he supports scientific research, his voting record indicates potential skepticism towards Earth science initiatives. The limited direct NASA science contract activity in his district means advocates will need to emphasize broader national and scientific benefits rather than solely local economic impact.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching the specific local impacts and student involvement stemming from Morehead State University's NASA contract for lunar node-1 support, to highlight direct benefits within his district.</li>
<li>Explore how specific NASA science activities, particularly those supporting lunar exploration or technological advancement, directly contribute to U.S. leadership in space and national competitiveness, aligning with his stated priorities.</li>
<li>Look into specific examples of how NASA's broader scientific research provides tangible benefits to Kentucky, such as advancements in materials science or public safety, to demonstrate practical returns on investment for his constituents.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Harold Rogers</h2>
<ul>
<li>Earned Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Laws degrees from the University of Kentucky.</li>
<li>Served in the Kentucky and North Carolina Army National Guard.</li>
<li>Worked as a private practice lawyer and Commonwealth's Attorney.</li>
<li>Longest-serving Kentucky Republican in federal office, elected in 1980.</li>
<li>Advocated for large environmental protection and clean-up programs in Appalachia.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Appropriations Subcommittee Chair:</strong> As Chair of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies, Representative Rogers directly oversees and influences the funding levels for NASA, including its science and exploration programs. (Authoritative Committee Data, 2025-09)</li>
<li><strong>Advocating for NASA Investment:</strong> In July 2024, Representative Rogers, as CJS Subcommittee Chairman, stated that the FY2025 CJS Appropriations Act makes "strong investments in NASA, providing an increase of $303 million above the fiscal year 2024 level" to boost "competitive edge in space exploration to the Moon and beyond." (U.S. Congressman Hal Rogers Press Release, 2024-07)</li>
<li><strong>Opposing Deep NASA Budget Cuts:</strong> In July 2025, the CJS Subcommittee, under Representative Rogers' leadership, approved an FY2026 bill that provides NASA $24.838 billion, rejecting a proposed $6 billion cut by the Administration and maintaining the FY2025 level. (SpacePolicyOnline.com, 2025-09; House Committee on Appropriations - Republicans, 2025-07)</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on U.S. Space Leadership and Scientific Research:</strong> Representative Rogers consistently emphasizes the importance of U.S. leadership in space exploration, scientific research, and technology advancement, particularly in light of competition with China. (U.S. Congressman Hal Rogers Press Release, 2024-07; U.S. Congressman Hal Rogers Press Release, 2023-04)</li>
<li><strong>Local Academic Engagement in Lunar Programs:</strong> Morehead State University in his district received a NASA contract for "Ground testing support for lunar node-1," demonstrating direct local involvement and interest in NASA's lunar exploration and related science activities, which Representative Rogers has cited as empowering the next generation of scientists. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024; U.S. Congressman Hal Rogers Press Release, 2023-04)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overall Discretionary Spending Reductions:</strong> As Chair of the House Committee on Appropriations: Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee, Representative Rogers has overseen CJS appropriations bills that propose overall discretionary spending levels below previous fiscal years, potentially limiting growth for NASA science activities.</li>
<li><strong>Prioritization of Law Enforcement and Justice Agencies:</strong> Representative Rogers' public statements and CJS bill summaries frequently emphasize significant investments in law enforcement, border security, and combating issues like fentanyl, which are also funded through the CJS bill and may compete for limited discretionary funds with NASA science.</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on "Core Mission" and Fiscal Responsibility:</strong> Representative Rogers has stated the need for NASA to remain focused on its "core mission" and for agencies to find "efficiencies and savings" due to national debt concerns, which could lead to scrutiny of science programs not directly tied to exploration or perceived as less essential.</li>
<li><strong>Skepticism towards Environmental Science:</strong> Representative Rogers' voting record with the League of Conservation Voters shows a low score (9% in 2024) and includes votes against measures related to climate and environmental justice, which may indicate a general posture of less support or increased scrutiny for NASA's Earth science activities.</li>
