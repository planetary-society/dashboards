    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.
    All AI-generated claims, assessments, and recommendations should be independently verified.

<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Higgins's general skepticism toward federal R&amp;D spending, as evidenced by his vote against the America COMPETES Act, and his stated prioritization of domestic economic issues over ambitious space exploration, suggest he may be resistant to calls for increased NASA science funding. His lack of a space-related committee assignment further limits his direct influence on these matters, and his past actions indicate potential skepticism towards federal Earth science initiatives.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, there is potential for engagement. Representative Higgins has supported overall federal appropriations bills that include NASA funding, and he co-sponsored a continuing resolution that would maintain current funding levels. Crucially, the University of Louisiana at Lafayette in his district has received significant NASA science grants for Earth and planetary science research, providing tangible local benefits that advocates can highlight as direct returns on investment for his constituents.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider identifying specific individuals or projects at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette benefiting from NASA science grants, to share tangible examples of local economic and research impact in his district.</li>
<li>Explore how the NASA-funded Earth science research on harmful algal blooms and wetland systems directly supports local industries like fishing, tourism, or public health, connecting to his stated priority of domestic economic well-being.</li>
<li>Look into framing NASA's Earth science activities as providing critical data and monitoring capabilities for local resource management and community resilience in Louisiana, rather than focusing on broader environmental policy.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Clay Higgins</h2>

</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Support for Federal Appropriations Including NASA Funding:</strong> Representative Higgins voted "Yea" on the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024 (H.R. 4366), which included the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2024, thereby supporting the overall federal budget that allocates funds to NASA's various missions, including science. This vote contributes to the federal funding stream that supports institutions like the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. (Congress.gov, 2024-03)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Local NASA Science Research Grants:</strong> The University of Louisiana at Lafayette, located within Representative Higgins's district, has received multiple NASA grants for science activities, including Earth science research on phytoplankton and harmful algal blooms, and planetary science research on presolar graphite grains. These grants demonstrate tangible economic and research benefits of NASA science funding within his constituency. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Co-sponsorship of FY2025 Continuing Appropriations:</strong> Representative Higgins is a co-sponsor of H.R.9494, the "Continuing Appropriations and Other Matters Act, 2025," introduced on September 10, 2024. This bill proposes to continue appropriations for FY2025 at FY2024 levels, including for the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2024, which funds NASA. This action supports the continuation of federal funding streams, indirectly benefiting local research institutions. (BillTrack50, 2024-09)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of Direct Congressional Platform:</strong> Representative Higgins holds no current space-related committee assignments, which limits his direct influence or formal responsibility to champion space science initiatives within Congress. (Authoritative Committee Data)</li>
<li><strong>Ideological Opposition to Federal Funding for R&amp;D:</strong> Representative Higgins voted against H.R. 4346 (America COMPETES Act of 2022), citing constitutional concerns about federal funding for private sector research and development, indicating a broader ideological barrier to government spending on science. (The Freedom Index, 2022-07-28)</li>
<li><strong>Prioritization of Domestic Economic Issues:</strong> Representative Higgins has stated that "We can't go to Mars until our people can go to the grocery store," suggesting that broad economic conditions take precedence over significant investments in ambitious space exploration programs. (Congress.gov, undated)</li>
<li><strong>Skepticism Towards Federal Environmental Science:</strong> Representative Higgins voted against H.R. 4346, which included provisions for NSF to support climate change research, and his official website highlights efforts to limit federal environmental regulations, suggesting potential skepticism towards federal Earth science activities. (The Freedom Index, 2022-07-28; Congressman Clay Higgins - House.gov, 2025-09-18)</li>
<li><strong>Limited STEM/Space Professional Background:</strong> Representative Higgins' biography indicates no public record of professional experience in STEM or space-related fields, which may lead to a lower inherent prioritization or less direct advocacy for space science issues.
