<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Appropriations</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Letlow's fiscal conservatism and emphasis on local economic impact may make advocating for increased NASA space science funding challenging. However, her position on the House Appropriations Committee is a significant opportunity, especially given the committee's recent bipartisan actions to reject proposed cuts and maintain NASA's Science Mission Directorate funding at current levels.</p>
<p>Her academic background and support for broader scientific research, alongside direct NASA Earth science grants to the University of Louisiana at Monroe in her district, suggest she could be receptive to arguments for protecting these programs from proposed cuts, such as the massive 47% reduction proposed for FY26. While securing a significant <em>increase</em> may be difficult, emphasizing the value of current science investments, particularly those with local ties and broader scientific merit, offers a path for guarded optimism.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching the specific NASA-funded precipitation science projects at the University of Louisiana at Monroe to highlight their local impact and connection to Representative Letlow's past roles and district priorities.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's space science activities contribute to fundamental research, higher education, and workforce development, aligning with her academic background and support for programs like NSF EPSCoR.</li>
<li>Look into examples of how NASA's space science data and technological advancements provide tangible benefits to Louisiana's key sectors, such as agriculture, infrastructure, or disaster preparedness, to demonstrate economic value and address competing priorities.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Julia Letlow</h2>
<ul>
<li>Holds a Ph.D. in Communications from the University of South Florida (2012).</li>
<li>Earned B.A. and M.A. degrees in speech communications.</li>
<li>Served as Director of Education and Patient Safety for Tulane University School of Medicine.</li>
<li>Worked as Director of External Affairs for the University of Louisiana at Monroe.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key Appropriations Committee Role:</strong> As a member of the House Committee on Appropriations, Representative Letlow directly influences federal spending, including NASA's budget, and the committee has recently advanced funding bills that reject proposed cuts to NASA. The committee's FY25 bill allocated $7.3 billion for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, matching FY24 enacted levels. Her role allows her to advocate for Louisiana's interests in federal funding, including for institutions like the University of Louisiana at Monroe (Representative Julia Letlow, 2023-01).</li>
<li><strong>Direct Local NASA Science Investment:</strong> The University of Louisiana at Monroe, located in her district, received NASA grants totaling $77,000 for precipitation science programs, specifically involving radiative transfer modeling and understanding GPM radiometer measurements, indicating a direct local benefit from NASA's Earth science activities (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024). Representative Letlow has a strong professional and academic history with ULM, having served as Director of External Affairs and Strategic Communications (Representative Julia Letlow, 2018-10).</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for Broader Scientific Research and Higher Education:</strong> Representative Letlow has publicly supported significant funding for scientific research programs, including securing $250 million for the National Science Foundation's EPSCoR program, which benefits Louisiana universities (Representative Julia Letlow, 2024-03). Her academic background, including a Ph.D. and roles in higher education administration, underscores her commitment to research and education (LegiStorm, N.D.).</li>
<li><strong>Engagement in Bipartisan NASA Funding Protection:</strong> The House Appropriations Committee, on which Rep. Letlow serves, has been involved in bipartisan efforts to reject proposed White House cuts to NASA's budget, with lawmakers urging protection for NASA's space science activities in recent funding measures (Astronomy Magazine, 2025-09; Akin Gump, 2025-09). This indicates a potential for collaboration on maintaining or growing NASA science investments.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Representative Letlow's public statements and votes consistently favor cutting federal spending and promoting government efficiency, which could lead to scrutiny of NASA's discretionary budget. (Letlow, 2025-06)</li>
<li><strong>Competing District Priorities:</strong> Representative Letlow prioritizes securing community project funding for local infrastructure, agriculture, and healthcare, indicating these district-specific needs may compete with broader NASA science investments. (Mt. Hermon Web TV, 2024-03; House.gov, FY24 Community Projects; KTVE, 2025-03)</li>
<li><strong>Stance on Energy Policy:</strong> Her vote to block a natural gas tax, citing burdens on the oil and gas industry, suggests a potential disinclination to support policies or funding perceived as detrimental to traditional energy sectors, which could indirectly affect certain Earth science programs. (Letlow, 2025-02)</li>
<li><strong>Limited Broader NASA Advocacy:</strong> While her district has received NASA-related grants, the public record does not show extensive proactive advocacy for broader NASA science or exploration programs beyond local economic ties. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on Local Economic Impact:</strong> Her focus on federal investments that directly translate to economic development and job creation within her district may lead her to prioritize projects with clear, immediate local benefits over more foundational or long-term space science initiatives. (Julia Letlow for Congress; KTVE, 2025-03)</li>
