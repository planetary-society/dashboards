<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Senator Markey demonstrates a strong record of supporting NASA science, particularly Earth science and specific astrophysics missions like the Chandra X-ray Observatory, which receives substantial funding and operational support in Massachusetts. His membership on the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee provides direct influence over NASA's budget, and he has actively advocated for increased funding for scientific research, including the National Science Foundation. The significant NASA science contracts and grants within Massachusetts, totaling over half a billion dollars in recent years for institutions like MIT and the Smithsonian, provide a clear local incentive for his continued support across various science disciplines.</p>
<p>While Senator Markey's extensive legislative agenda and strong emphasis on Earth science could mean a broader "NASA space science" ask faces competing priorities, his past actions defending critical science programs suggest he is receptive to protecting these investments. Given the proposed 47% cut to NASA's science budget in FY2026, advocating for robust funding across all Science Mission Directorate activities, beyond just Earth science, will be crucial. His demonstrated support for local scientific endeavors and U.S. leadership in space science offers a foundation for engagement, despite the significant budget challenges.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider highlighting the direct economic and scientific benefits of NASA science investments to Massachusetts, specifically referencing the Chandra X-ray Observatory and its operations at the Smithsonian in Cambridge, aligning with his past advocacy for the program.</li>
<li>Explore how increased investment in NASA's Earth science activities directly supports Senator Markey's long-standing commitment to climate change research and environmental policy, connecting it to local projects like the TEMPO mission.</li>
<li>Look into how robust funding for NASA's Science Mission Directorate strengthens the broader U.S. scientific enterprise and workforce, leveraging his role on the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee and his advocacy for NSF funding.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Edward J. Markey</h2>
<ul>
<li>Earned BA from Boston College (1968) and JD from Boston College Law School (1972).</li>
<li>Served in the United States Army Reserve from 1968 to 1973.</li>
<li>Chaired House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming (2007-2011).</li>
<li>Long-standing focus on climate change, energy policy, and technology issues.</li>
<li>Married to Susan Blumenthal, former Assistant U.S. Surgeon General.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Advocacy for Chandra X-ray Observatory:</strong> Senator Markey, along with other Massachusetts lawmakers, actively advocated for the restoration of funding for the Chandra X-ray Observatory after NASA proposed significant cuts in its FY2025 budget, emphasizing the importance of U.S. leadership in X-ray astronomy. This directly supports NASA's astrophysics science activities. (Markey, 2024-10-31; Moulton, Warren, Markey, 2024-06-12) The Smithsonian Institution in Cambridge, MA, receives substantial contracts for the operation and science support of the Chandra X-ray Observatory. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support for NASA Earth Science and Climate Research:</strong> Senator Markey has a long-standing focus on climate change and environmental policy, which aligns with NASA's Earth science activities. He recently announced legislation to improve longer-term weather and climate forecasting at NOAA, highlighting the need for investments in research and data. (Senator Edward Markey of Massachusetts, 2024-07-31; Senator Edward Markey of Massachusetts, 2022-11-04) The Smithsonian Institution in Cambridge, MA, has a significant contract for the TEMPO mission, which measures air pollution over North America, directly supporting Earth science. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Membership on Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee:</strong> As a member of this committee, Senator Markey has direct oversight and influence over NASA's budget and policy, including its science mission directorate. This position provides a platform to advocate for increased investment in NASA science. (U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, &amp; Transportation, 2025-09-03; SpacePolicyOnline.com, 2023-05-17)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Leadership in NSF Funding Advocacy:</strong> Senator Markey led a Congressional letter advocating for increased funding for the National Science Foundation (NSF) in FY2026, emphasizing the importance of scientific missions and supporting the skilled workforce, which often collaborates with or feeds into NASA science. (American Astronomical Society, No Date) Boston University and Harvard College in Massachusetts receive grants for heliophysics and atmospheric research, which are often supported by NSF and align with NASA science. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Engagement with Massachusetts-based NASA Science Missions:</strong> Senator Markey's office has engaged with institutions like MIT and the Smithsonian, which are involved in significant NASA science missions such as the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) for exoplanet discovery and the Chandra X-ray Observatory. This local connection provides a strong incentive for him to support these programs. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024; NASA, No Date)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competing Legislative Priorities:</strong> Senator Markey's extensive legislative agenda, encompassing numerous social, economic, and environmental issues beyond space, may limit the dedicated focus and advocacy for all NASA science and exploration activities.</li>
<li><strong>Potential for Budget Reallocation Advocacy:</strong> Senator Markey has previously advocated for reallocating federal funds from the military to address climate change and other priorities, indicating a willingness to consider shifting resources across the federal budget.</li>
<li><strong>Strong Emphasis on Earth Science:</strong> While a consistent advocate for NASA's Earth science activities, particularly those related to climate change, and demonstrating support for specific astrophysics missions like Chandra, his public record shows a more pronounced and frequent focus on Earth science compared to other Science Mission Directorate disciplines or human exploration programs.</li>
<li><strong>Scrutiny of Commercial Space Partnerships:</strong> Senator Markey has demonstrated a critical stance regarding potential conflicts of interest in commercial space partnerships, as evidenced by his questioning of a NASA Administrator nominee about ties to SpaceX. This scrutiny, while aimed at transparency, could lead to a more cautious approach to certain commercial exploration initiatives.</li>
