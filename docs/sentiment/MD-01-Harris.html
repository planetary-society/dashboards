<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Appropriations</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Harris's strong fiscal conservatism and leadership in subcommittees outside of NASA's purview suggest a challenging environment for advocating increased space science funding, especially given his skepticism towards certain climate-related science. His past advocacy for reducing indirect research costs also indicates a potential hurdle for university-led science programs.</p>
<p>However, his membership on the Appropriations Committee, scientific background, and recent bipartisan engagement on Maryland's space industry, where he acknowledged space exploration as "vital," offer potential avenues for influence. The significant NASA contracts and grants in his district, particularly for Mars exploration and Europa mission support, provide a strong local economic argument that could resonate, despite the proposed FY26 budget cuts.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching specific employees or recent successes at Northrop Grumman (Elkton), Alliant Techsystems (Elkton), or the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science (Cambridge) that directly benefit from NASA science funding, to highlight local jobs and scientific contributions.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's space science activities, particularly those with local ties like Mars Sample Return, contribute to U.S. technological leadership and national security, framing investment as a strategic imperative that aligns with his concerns about foreign adversaries.</li>
<li>Look into his past statements or actions regarding the broader Maryland space industry, especially his participation in the October 2023 bipartisan meeting, to acknowledge his appreciation for the sector and his influential role on the Appropriations Committee.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Andy Harris</h2>
<ul>
<li>Earned BS in biology (1977) and MD (1980) from Johns Hopkins University.</li>
<li>Holds an MHS in health policy and management from Johns Hopkins (1995).</li>
<li>Practiced as an anesthesiologist and associate professor at Johns Hopkins Hospital.</li>
<li>Served as a commander in the U.S. Naval Reserve Medical Corps.</li>
<li>Supports technological solutions like nuclear fusion for climate change.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local Economic Impact:</strong> Significant NASA contracts and grants in his district for Mars exploration, Europa mission support, and Earth science research directly benefit local businesses and institutions. Local connection: Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation (Elkton, MD), Alliant Techsystems Operations LLC (Elkton, MD), and University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science (Cambridge, MD). (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Appropriations Committee Membership:</strong> As a member of the House Committee on Appropriations, Representative Harris holds a key position to influence federal spending decisions, including NASA's budget for science and exploration programs. Local connection: N/A. [cite: <space_committees>]</li>
<li><strong>Scientific and Medical Background:</strong> His professional background as a physician and associate professor at Johns Hopkins University suggests an understanding and appreciation for scientific research and evidence-based inquiry. Local connection: Johns Hopkins University is a prominent research institution in Maryland.</li>
<li><strong>Bipartisan Engagement on Maryland Space Industry:</strong> Representative Harris participated in a bipartisan Maryland congressional delegation meeting in October 2023 with local space industry leaders, stating that "Space exploration is a vital industry here in Maryland." Local connection: The meeting included NASA Goddard, Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL), and the Space Telescope Science Institute.</li>
<li><strong>Strategic Competition and National Security:</strong> Representative Harris has voiced concerns about national security threats from foreign adversaries, which aligns with arguments for maintaining U.S. leadership in space exploration and technology to counter global competition. Local connection: NASA programs with local ties, such as Mars Sample Return, contribute to U.S. technological and scientific leadership.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strong Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Representative Harris consistently advocates for significant federal budget cuts and fiscal responsibility, which could lead to pressure for reduced appropriations across non-defense discretionary spending, including NASA science and exploration. (WYPR, 2025-03; Andy Harris for Congress, undated; YouTube, 2024-10)</li>
<li><strong>Skepticism towards certain climate-related science funding:</strong> As Chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, he supported targeting "Green New Scam" IRA tax credits, and the House FY26 agriculture appropriations bill, which he chairs, seeks to remove funding for USDA's Climate Hubs, indicating potential resistance to broader Earth science initiatives. (Andy Harris, 2025-04; NSAC, 2025-09)</li>
<li><strong>Primary focus on other Appropriations Subcommittees:</strong> His leadership roles as Chairman of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies subcommittee and membership on the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies subcommittee suggest his primary appropriations focus may lie outside of NASA science and exploration. (House.gov, undated; Andy Harris, 2025-01)</li>
<li><strong>Past advocacy for reducing indirect research costs:</strong> In 2017, he expressed a desire to reduce federal indirect costs for research grants to fund more direct research, a stance that, if applied to NASA, could impact university research infrastructure and support. (STAT, 2017-06)</li>
