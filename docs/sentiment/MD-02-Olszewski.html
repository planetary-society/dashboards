    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.
    All AI-generated claims, assessments, and recommendations should be independently verified.
    This is an experimental feature, and intended to provide guidance and inspiration for outreach strategies for your meeting. Feedback is welcome: casey.dreier@planetary.org.

<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Olszewski's lack of a relevant committee assignment and absence of explicit public statements on NASA science funding suggest a cautious approach is warranted. However, his district benefits from NASA contracts supporting planetary science and heliophysics, and his background in environmental protection and scientific inquiry aligns with NASA's Earth Science mission and broader research goals. These local connections and academic background offer potential avenues for engagement despite his focus on other legislative priorities as a new member.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching the specific work and local employees at Brimrose Technology Corp, Space Exploration Engineering, LLC, Central Engineering, Inc., and Western Industrial Machining, Inc., to highlight the direct economic benefits of NASA science contracts in his district.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's Earth Science missions and climate research directly support environmental monitoring and climate action goals, aligning with Representative Olszewski's past priorities as Baltimore County Executive and the county's Climate Action Plan.</li>
<li>Look into the specific research collaborations between UMBC and NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, and the work of Sciencecast Inc. in advancing open science, to connect NASA's scientific endeavors with his academic background and interest in scientific dissemination.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Johnny Olszewski</h2>
<ul>
<li>Earned a doctorate from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County in 2017.</li>
<li>Served two terms in the Maryland House of Delegates (2006-2015).</li>
<li>Served as Baltimore County Executive from 2018 to 2025.</li>
<li>Prioritized environmental initiatives, including renewable energy, as County Executive.</li>
<li>Previously worked as a senior account executive at SAS Institute.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local NASA Contracts:</strong> Representative Olszewski's district benefits from NASA contracts supporting advanced manufacturing and scientific instrument development for planetary science and heliophysics missions. Local connection: Brimrose Technology Corp (Sparks, MD) develops spectrometers for lunar exploration, Space Exploration Engineering, LLC (Towson, MD) works on heliophysics systems, and Central Engineering, Inc. (Upperco, MD) and Western Industrial Machining, Inc. (Hampstead, MD) provide fabrication services for Goddard Space Flight Center.</li>
<li><strong>Environmental Prioritization:</strong> As Baltimore County Executive, Olszewski's administration prioritized environmental protection and climate action, which aligns with NASA's Earth Science mission and its role in climate monitoring and research. Local connection: Baltimore County's Climate Action Plan was announced under his administration.</li>
<li><strong>Academic Background:</strong> His doctorate from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), a research institution with significant ties to NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, suggests an appreciation for scientific inquiry and federal research funding. Local connection: UMBC hosts the Joint Center for Earth Systems Technology (JCET), a cooperative institute with NASA GSFC.</li>
<li><strong>Support for Scientific Dissemination:</strong> A grant within his district supports advancing equitable scientific publishing through open science digital innovations, indicating an understanding of the importance of accessible scientific research. Local connection: Sciencecast Inc. (Towson, MD) received a grant for this purpose.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of Committee Assignment:</strong> Representative Olszewski does not hold any current committee assignments relevant to space policy or appropriations in the 119th Congress, limiting his direct influence on NASA's budget and policy decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Competing Legislative Priorities:</strong> As a new member of Congress, Representative Olszewski's stated priorities and past record as County Executive indicate a focus on local issues, infrastructure, healthcare, education, and environmental initiatives, which may compete for his attention and advocacy compared to broader NASA science and exploration funding.</li>
<li><strong>Absence of Explicit Stance:</strong> No public record from the last 24 months explicitly details Representative Olszewski's stance, statements, or actions regarding specific funding levels or growth for NASA's Science Mission Directorate or exploration programs.</li>
</ul>
