<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Appropriations</li>
<li>Member, House Committee on Appropriations: Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee</li>
<li>Member, Planetary Science Caucus</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Ivey's position on the House Appropriations Committee and its Commerce, Justice, Science Subcommittee, coupled with his co-chairmanship of the Advancing Humanity in Space Caucus and membership in the Planetary Science Caucus, indicates a strong foundational interest in space. His recent opposition to proposed cuts to NASA Goddard missions, a significant local employer and research hub, directly aligns with protecting NASA's science budget. The substantial NASA science contracts and grants totaling nearly $4 billion over three years to entities like Honeywell, KBR Wyle, and the University of Maryland in his district provide a compelling local economic incentive to support these activities.</p>
<p>While his broad legislative agenda and lack of explicit public advocacy for <em>increased</em> NASA science funding present a challenge, the potential for a drastic 47% cut to NASA's Science Mission Directorate in FY26 could shift his focus. Given the immense local economic and scientific stake, particularly at NASA Goddard and the University of Maryland, he is likely to be receptive to arguments emphasizing the critical role of sustained investment in space science for his constituents and U.S. leadership. Advocates should highlight how proposed cuts would directly impact his district's jobs and research.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching specific projects or job roles supported by the $3.9 billion in NASA science contracts and grants within his district, particularly at NASA Goddard and the University of Maryland, to highlight the direct local economic and scientific benefits of increased investment.</li>
<li>Explore how increased NASA science funding directly supports the goals of the Advancing Humanity in Space Caucus, such as promoting U.S. leadership and educating members on the impact of budget decisions, aligning with his role on the Appropriations Committee.</li>
<li>Look into gathering personal stories from constituents who work on or benefit from NASA Goddard's science missions or UMD's NASA-funded research, demonstrating how increased science investment would further protect and grow these vital local assets he has already championed.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Glenn Ivey</h2>
<ul>
<li>Earned A.B. from Princeton University and J.D. from Harvard Law School.</li>
<li>Served as State's Attorney for Prince George's County, Maryland (2002-2011).</li>
<li>Worked as counsel for U.S. Senators and as an Assistant U.S. Attorney.</li>
<li>Chaired Maryland Public Service Commission, regulating electric power and telecommunications.</li>
<li>Practiced law as a partner and taught law at Harvard and University of Maryland.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Appropriations Committee Influence:</strong> Representative Ivey's role on the House Committee on Appropriations and its Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee provides a direct avenue to advocate for and protect NASA's science budget. (House Committee on Appropriations, 2025)</li>
<li><strong>Defense of NASA Goddard Missions:</strong> He recently joined the Maryland delegation in opposing proposed cuts to NASA Goddard missions, emphasizing their critical role in space exploration, understanding the universe, and technological innovation. This directly supports NASA science activities.</li>
<li><strong>Co-Chair of Advancing Humanity in Space Caucus:</strong> As a co-chair of the bipartisan Advancing Humanity in Space Congressional Caucus, Representative Ivey has stated his commitment to promoting U.S. leadership in space exploration and ensuring policies support the space community, including science, while educating members on the impact of budget cuts.</li>
<li><strong>Planetary Science Caucus Membership:</strong> His membership in the Congressional Planetary Science Caucus indicates a specific interest in advancing federal policies that support space science, research, and exploration, including the search for life and raising awareness of economic benefits.</li>
<li><strong>Strong Local NASA and University Ties:</strong> Representative Ivey's district is home to NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of Maryland, College Park, which receive substantial NASA contracts and grants for electrical engineering, multidisciplinary engineering, and Earth and space science research, demonstrating a significant local economic and scientific stake in NASA's success. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competing Legislative Priorities:</strong> Representative Ivey's official website and public statements indicate a broad focus on numerous domestic issues such as healthcare, education, criminal justice, and infrastructure, which may limit the attention and advocacy he can dedicate to proactively increasing NASA science and exploration funding.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Explicit Advocacy for NASA Science Growth:</strong> Despite his membership on the House Committee on Appropriations, its Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee, and the Planetary Science Caucus, recent public records do not show explicit statements or legislative efforts specifically advocating for <em>increased</em> investment in NASA's Science Mission Directorate activities.</li>
