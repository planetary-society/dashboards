<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Appropriations</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Hoyer has recently demonstrated strong, vocal opposition to proposed cuts to NASA science, particularly for missions like the Roman Space Telescope which has direct contract support in his district. His consistent advocacy for NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, located in his district, and his successful efforts to reinstate Earth science missions like GEDI, highlight a clear commitment to NASA's scientific endeavors and their local impact. As a member of the House Committee on Appropriations, he holds a key position to influence NASA's budget and has explicitly linked NASA's work to national security and economic competitiveness.</p>
<p>However, his consistent emphasis on fiscal responsibility and deficit reduction, alongside a broad range of competing legislative priorities, suggests that securing significant new investments for NASA science may be challenging. While he is likely receptive to arguments against cuts and for maintaining programs with strong local ties, advocates should be prepared to frame increased science funding within the context of economic benefits, national security, and the efficient use of existing resources, rather than solely as new spending.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider how to highlight the direct economic and scientific benefits of increased NASA science investment for his district, specifically connecting to the Roman Space Telescope contract and the local grants for climate and hydrological research, which align with his past advocacy for Goddard and Earth science.</li>
<li>Explore framing increased NASA science funding as a strategic investment that supports national security and economic competitiveness, aligning with his stated concerns about competing with China and potentially addressing his fiscal responsibility stance by emphasizing long-term returns.</li>
<li>Look into acknowledging his influential role on the House Committee on Appropriations and his history of successfully advocating for specific research initiatives, encouraging him to leverage this experience to champion robust funding for NASA's science portfolio.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Steny H. Hoyer</h2>
<ul>
<li>Graduated University of Maryland (B.A. magna cum laude, 1963) and Georgetown Law (J.D., 1966).</li>
<li>Retired attorney; served as Maryland State Senator, including State Senate President.</li>
<li>Long-serving U.S. Representative; twice served as House Majority Leader.</li>
<li>Advocated for epilepsy research; received Congressional Leadership Award from Epilepsy Foundation.</li>
<li>Supported civilian nuclear cooperation with India.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Opposition to proposed NASA science cuts:</strong> Representative Hoyer recently (2025-04) vocally opposed proposed cuts to NASA Goddard missions, including the Roman Space Telescope, stating that "savaged NASA science" would "savage our entire exploration program" and expressing hope for bipartisan support. This stance indicates a potential openness to rejecting cuts and supporting program growth, especially given the presence of NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in his district and direct contract support for the Roman Space Telescope. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Advocacy for Earth science and climate research:</strong> Representative Hoyer, along with other Maryland delegation members, successfully advocated for the reinstatement of the Maryland-led Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) mission for climate change research in 2024, highlighting its importance for understanding Earth's ecosystems and climate impacts. This demonstrates support for NASA's Earth science activities, which have local connections through the University of Maryland and grants in his district for related research. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consistent support for local NASA facilities:</strong> Representative Hoyer has a long history of advocating for NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, located in his district, and recently (2023-10) emphasized its role in deepening knowledge of the universe and addressing the climate crisis, stating Congress should continue supporting this crucial work. This consistent advocacy for a major NASA center suggests a strong inclination to support its missions and funding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Recognition of economic and national security benefits:</strong> In 2025, Representative Hoyer explicitly linked NASA's work at Goddard to national security and economic impact, stating it is "critical as we compete with China in science and in space and in technology." This perspective indicates a broader understanding of space investment beyond pure science, potentially aligning with arguments for program growth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Influential position on the House Committee on Appropriations:</strong> As a Member of the House Committee on Appropriations, Representative Hoyer holds a direct and influential position to shape federal spending, including NASA's budget for science and exploration activities. This committee assignment provides a strategic avenue for him to advocate for increased investment in NASA science.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiscal Responsibility Stance:</strong> Representative Hoyer consistently advocates for deficit reduction and adherence to "pay-as-you-go" principles, which could lead to pressure for spending cuts across all discretionary programs, including NASA science, in a challenging fiscal environment. (Congressman Steny Hoyer, 2025-09)</li>
<li><strong>Broad Legislative Priorities:</strong> As a senior member of Congress and the House Committee on Appropriations, Representative Hoyer's public statements and community funding requests indicate a wide range of priorities, such as healthcare, infrastructure, and economic development, which compete for federal resources alongside NASA's science and exploration initiatives. (Congressman Steny Hoyer, 2024-03; House Committee on Appropriations, 2024-05; Congressman Steny Hoyer, 2025-09)</li>
