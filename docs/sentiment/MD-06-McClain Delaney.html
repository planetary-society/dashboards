<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative McClain Delaney's assignment to the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology offers a direct opportunity for advocacy regarding NASA's Science Mission Directorate. Her public support for increased climate science research aligns with NASA's Earth science goals, and her district benefits from substantial NASA contracts, including for International Space Station cargo missions and a grant for biological and physical sciences research on growing food in space. This, combined with her emphasis on innovation and STEM, and recent bipartisan committee concern over proposed science cuts, suggests a foundation for receptiveness.</p>
<p>However, advocates should be aware of her consistent prioritization of immediate constituent needs like healthcare and economic relief, which may compete with increased NASA science investments, especially given the proposed 47% budget cut for FY26. Her strong stance on fiscal prudence and active advocacy for other federal research agencies like NIST and NIH indicate that NASA science funding will contend with other priorities. Therefore, while there are clear points of alignment, advocates will need to clearly articulate the tangible benefits of NASA science for her district and national interests.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider how NASA's Earth science activities directly contribute to the climate science research she has publicly supported, and how this data informs policy and public understanding, aligning with her communications background.</li>
<li>Explore the specific local impact of NASA's biological and physical sciences grant in Germantown, connecting this research on growing food in space to American innovation and the empowerment of scientists within her district.</li>
<li>Look into recent bipartisan statements or actions by members of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology regarding the importance of NASA's Science Mission Directorate to highlight potential common ground for increased investment.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About April McClain Delaney</h2>
<ul>

<li>Served as Deputy Administrator of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).</li>
<li>Practiced as a media lawyer and founded Common Sense Media's D.C. division.</li>
<li>Supported increasing funding for climate science research.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Committee Membership:</strong> Representative McClain Delaney's assignment to the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology provides a direct oversight role for NASA's activities, including its Science Mission Directorate. (Congresswoman April McClain Delaney, 2025-01-14)</li>
<li><strong>Support for Climate Science:</strong> She has publicly stated that Congress should increase basic research in climate science, aligning with NASA's Earth science objectives. (April McClain Delaney Official Website)</li>
<li><strong>District Economic Interest:</strong> Her district benefits from significant NASA contracts, including for International Space Station cargo missions and a grant for biological and physical sciences research on growing food in space. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for Innovation and STEM:</strong> Representative McClain Delaney emphasizes investing in American innovation and empowering engineers and scientists, which are core outcomes of NASA's science and exploration programs. (Congresswoman April McClain Delaney, 2025-01-14)</li>
<li><strong>Potential for Bipartisan Collaboration on Science Funding:</strong> Members of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, including the Ranking Member, have recently demonstrated bipartisan concern over proposed cuts to NASA's Science Mission Directorate, indicating a potential for collaborative efforts to support program growth. (Congresswoman Valerie Foushee, 2025-07-18)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competing Priorities Focus:</strong> Representative McClain Delaney's public statements consistently prioritize immediate constituent needs such as healthcare affordability, social safety nets, and economic relief, which may compete with increased investment in NASA science during budget allocations. (McClain Delaney, 2025-09; McClain Delaney, 2025-05; McClain Delaney, 2025-04)</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal Prudence Stance:</strong> Representative McClain Delaney emphasizes fiscal prudence for long-term stability and advocates for a bipartisan approach to reduce spending, which could lead to scrutiny of large-scale government investments, including space science, if they are not perceived as directly addressing immediate economic challenges. (McClain Delaney, 2025-09; McClain Delaney, 2025-07; McClain Delaney, 2025-04)</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for Other Research Agencies:</strong> While generally supportive of research, Representative McClain Delaney has actively condemned cuts to other federal research agencies like NIST and NIH, indicating that NASA science funding may compete with her advocacy for these other scientific priorities. (McClain Delaney, 2025-09; McClain Delaney, 2025-07; McClain Delaney, 2025-04)</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on Localized Community Projects:</strong> Her significant focus on securing Community Project Funding for local infrastructure, public safety, and education projects within her district may lead to less direct advocacy for broader NASA science initiatives that lack immediate, tangible local impact. (McClain Delaney, 2025-07; McClain Delaney, 2025-05)</li>
