    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.

<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Raskin may be receptive to advocacy for increased NASA space science funding, particularly given his district's significant economic ties to NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and his past opposition to federal funding freezes. His active participation in bipartisan efforts to support local space industry stakeholders and specific NASA missions like OSAM-1 demonstrates a clear interest in protecting and promoting Maryland's space sector. Furthermore, his role in the Congressional Freethought Caucus and advocacy for science-based policy align with the broader goals of space science.</p>
<p>However, advocates should be aware that space science is not a primary focus among his publicly stated priorities, which are wide-ranging. His lack of direct legislative leverage on the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee or relevant appropriations subcommittees means his influence on specific funding decisions may be indirect. Therefore, while he is likely to be sympathetic to the economic and scientific benefits of NASA's work, direct action on the proposed FY26 cuts may require broader coalition-building.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching specific individuals or families in the 8th district whose livelihoods are directly supported by the NASA Science contracts listed, such as those at Adnet Systems or Business Integra, to share personal stories of local economic impact.</li>
<li>Explore how increased NASA science investment directly aligns with Representative Raskin's commitment to science-based policy and free inquiry, emphasizing the role of scientific discovery in addressing global challenges and advancing human knowledge.</li>
<li>Look into how proposed increases in NASA's space science budget could directly benefit ongoing or future science missions at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, reinforcing the Representative's past advocacy for the center and its projects.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Jamie Raskin</h2>
<ul>
<li>Graduated magna cum laude from Harvard College and Harvard Law School.</li>
<li>Served over 25 years as a constitutional law professor at American University.</li>
<li>Co-founded and co-chairs the Congressional Freethought Caucus, promoting science-based policy.</li>
<li>Previously served as a Maryland State Senator from 2007 to 2016.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Strong Local Economic Interest in NASA Goddard:</strong> Representative Raskin has actively opposed proposed cuts to NASA Goddard missions and emphasized the importance of Maryland's space science sector to the state's economy and innovation, participating in bipartisan delegation efforts to support local space industry stakeholders. His district benefits from substantial NASA Science Mission Directorate contracts supporting Goddard Space Flight Center. (Hoyer, 2025-04-12; Raskin, 2023-10-19; USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Advocacy for Specific NASA Missions:</strong> Representative Raskin joined the Maryland delegation in pressing NASA for detailed explanations regarding the cancellation of the OSAM-1 mission, a space technology project developed at Goddard Space Flight Center, after Congress had provided funding for its continuation. (Van Hollen, 2024-09-19; citybiz, 2024-09-22)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Promotion of Science-Based Policy:</strong> As co-chair of the Congressional Freethought Caucus, Representative Raskin advocates for policy solutions based on reason and science, and recently co-sponsored a resolution celebrating the importance of the scientific method and free inquiry. (American Humanist Association, 2024-05-01; Wikipedia, 2018)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Opposition to Federal Funding Freezes:</strong> Representative Raskin has publicly opposed sweeping freezes on federal funding, arguing that such actions threaten essential programs and represent an unconstitutional challenge to congressional authority, indicating a general stance against cuts to federal appropriations. (Raskin, 2025-01-28)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competing Priorities Focus:</strong> Representative Raskin's public statements and official priorities pages highlight a wide array of legislative concerns, including civil rights, healthcare, and gun safety, without explicitly featuring NASA or space science as a primary focus.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Direct Legislative Lever:</strong> Representative Raskin does not hold a position on the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee or any appropriations subcommittees directly responsible for NASA funding, which limits his direct legislative influence on space policy.</li>
</ul>
