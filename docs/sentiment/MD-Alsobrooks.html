<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Senator Alsobrooks's history of advocating for federal projects that bring economic benefits to Maryland, combined with the state's substantial NASA science contracts and research institutions, suggests a foundational receptiveness to protecting these assets. However, her primary legislative focus on "kitchen-table" issues and lack of a direct space-related committee assignment indicate that proactively championing significant new growth in NASA science funding may not be a top priority.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, the significant local economic impact from NASA's science mission activities, particularly in astrophysics and Earth science, presents a compelling case for advocacy. Highlighting how a proposed 47% budget cut would directly harm Maryland's research institutions, jobs, and scientific leadership could shift her focus from merely protecting existing programs to recognizing the need for sustained investment and growth.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching specific examples of how NASA science contracts and grants, particularly those in Prince George's County and surrounding areas, translate into local job creation, economic development, and educational opportunities for Marylanders, aligning with her past advocacy for federal investment in the state.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's Earth science and climate research initiatives directly address "kitchen-table" issues important to Maryland, such as coastal resilience, agricultural impacts, or public health, to connect increased science funding to her stated legislative priorities.</li>
<li>Look into the specific scientific achievements and workforce contributions of Maryland institutions like Johns Hopkins APL, the University of Maryland, and the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy to major NASA science missions, emphasizing how further investment would strengthen these local assets.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Angela D. Alsobrooks</h2>
<ul>
<li>Holds a B.A. from Duke University and a J.D. from University of Maryland School of Law.</li>
<li>Served eight years as Prince George's County State's Attorney.</li>
<li>Elected Prince George's County Executive, serving from 2018 to 2024.</li>
<li>As County Executive, advocated for the FBI headquarters relocation to Prince George's County.</li>
<li>No public record found of military service or direct space/science professional experience.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local Economic Impact:</strong> Significant NASA contracts and grants totaling billions of dollars for science-related activities, including Hubble and JWST operations, aerospace R&amp;D, and Earth science research, directly support jobs and institutions in Maryland. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Support for Research Institutions:</strong> Maryland-based universities and research associations, such as Johns Hopkins APL and the University of Maryland, receive substantial NASA funding for space and Earth science research, fostering local scientific and technological advancement. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for Federal Investment:</strong> As Prince George's County Executive, Senator Alsobrooks advocated for the relocation of the FBI headquarters to the county, demonstrating a history of supporting federal projects that bring economic benefits and jobs to Maryland. (Biography)</li>
<li><strong>Astrophysics Program Engagement:</strong> Maryland institutions, notably the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy in Baltimore, are deeply involved in the operations and science programs of major astrophysics missions like the Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Earth Science Research Focus:</strong> Universities Space Research Association and the University of Maryland receive substantial grants for Earth system science and climate research, indicating a strong local interest in NASA's Earth science activities. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competing Legislative Priorities:</strong> Senator Alsobrooks's public record and campaign platform heavily emphasize "kitchen-table" issues such as healthcare, education, and economic opportunity, which may draw her primary legislative focus away from proactively advocating for significant increases in NASA science funding.</li>
<li><strong>No Direct Space-Related Committee Role:</strong> Senator Alsobrooks does not hold a current committee assignment directly related to space, science, or commerce, which could limit her formal opportunities to shape and champion legislation specifically aimed at growing NASA's Science Mission Directorate. (Authoritative <space_committees> data)</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on Protecting Existing Assets vs. Proactive Growth:</strong> While she has strongly defended NASA Goddard and its missions against proposed budget cuts, her public statements primarily reflect a reactive stance to protect existing investments rather than a proactive push for substantial new growth in NASA science budgets.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Public Record on Specific Science Disciplines:</strong> Her advocacy for NASA science broadly mentions "climate research, Earth science, and space exploration," but there is no extensive public record detailing specific support or understanding of individual science disciplines like astrophysics, planetary science, heliophysics, or biological and physical sciences.</li>
