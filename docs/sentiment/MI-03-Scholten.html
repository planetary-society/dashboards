    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.
    All AI-generated claims, assessments, and recommendations should be independently verified.

<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Scholten's public record suggests her primary focus lies with healthcare, the economy, and education, rather than explicitly prioritizing NASA or broader space science. While she has engaged with the House Science Committee, her lack of a direct space-related committee assignment and limited explicit advocacy for astrophysics or planetary science indicate that increased NASA science funding may not be a top-tier concern. Furthermore, the relatively low total NASA science contract value in her district over the past three years suggests a limited direct economic stake in these specific programs.</p>
<p>However, there are promising avenues for advocacy. Her strong support for federal research, STEM education, and climate action aligns well with NASA's Earth Science mission and the broader scientific enterprise. The presence of NASA science-related contracts in her district, even if modest, provides a tangible local connection. Highlighting how NASA science investments contribute to research, technological innovation, and workforce development could resonate with her demonstrated commitment to these areas.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching the specific NASA science contracts held by International Met Systems Inc. and Clean Rooms International Inc. in Grand Rapids to highlight local economic impact and contributions to scientific missions.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's broader Science Mission Directorate activities, beyond Earth science, contribute to STEM education, workforce development, and federal research funding, aligning with her stated priorities.</li>
<li>Look into how NASA's space science discoveries and technological advancements have tangible benefits for Michigan residents or address issues like climate change and economic development that are important to her constituents.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Support for Federal Research Funding:</strong> Representative Scholten has publicly opposed cuts to health research funding and secured over $1 million in federal funding for Grand Valley State University to establish a West Michigan Trustworthy AI Consortium for research and innovation, demonstrating a general commitment to federal investment in research. Grand Valley State University is located within her district. (Grand Rapids Reporter, 2025-04; Representative Hillary Scholten, 2025-08)</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for STEM Education and Workforce Development:</strong> Scholten actively supports STEM education initiatives, including hosting the Congressional App Challenge and securing federal funds for automation training at Grand Rapids Community College, which prepares a workforce relevant to advanced technology sectors. Grand Rapids Community College and the winner of the Congressional App Challenge (City High Middle School) are in her district. (Grand Rapids Community College, 2023-02; Official Press Release, 2025-01)</li>
<li><strong>Direct NASA Science-Related Contracts in District:</strong> Companies in her district, International Met Systems Inc. and Clean Rooms International Inc., have received NASA contracts for components like radiosondes for atmospheric research and cleanroom equipment essential for sensitive space science instrumentation. Both companies are located in Grand Rapids, MI. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Commitment to Environmental Science and Climate Action:</strong> Scholten's stated priorities include fighting climate change and protecting the Great Lakes, aligning with NASA's Earth Science mission, and she has promoted local conservation efforts supported by federal grants. Her district includes parts of the Great Lakes region and local conservation projects. (Hillary Scholten for Congress, 2022-02; Grand Rapids Reporter, 2025-08)</li>
<li><strong>Engagement with Science-Related Congressional Activities:</strong> Despite not holding a space-related committee assignment, Representative Scholten participated in a "Members' Day hearing" for the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology during the 118th Congress, indicating an interest in the committee's jurisdiction, which includes NASA. (Congress.gov, 2023-2024)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competing Priorities Focus:</strong> Representative Scholten's public statements and campaign priorities consistently emphasize issues such as healthcare, the economy, education, and infrastructure, without explicitly highlighting NASA or space science as a primary focus. (Hillary Scholten for Congress, 2024), (WGVU NEWS, 2024-11), (Ballotpedia, 2024)</li>
<li><strong>Limited Explicit Advocacy for Broader NASA Science:</strong> While she has demonstrated support for environmental and climate science initiatives, her public record does not show specific advocacy for NASA's broader Science Mission Directorate activities, including astrophysics, planetary science, heliophysics, or biological and physical sciences. (Hillary Scholten for Congress, 2024), (Dingell Leads Michigan Delegation House Democrats, 2025-09), (Representative Hillary Scholten, 2024-12)</li>
<li><strong>Absence of Direct Space-Related Committee Role:</strong> Representative Scholten does not currently hold any committee assignments related to space in the 119th Congress, which may limit her direct legislative platform for advocating for NASA's space science and exploration programs. (Authoritative Committee Data, 2025-09-23)</li>
