    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.

<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Walberg's strong fiscal conservatism and consistent calls for reduced government spending present a significant hurdle for advocating increased NASA space science funding, especially in light of the proposed 47% cut for FY2026. His past statements questioning human-driven climate change also suggest potential resistance to NASA's Earth Science initiatives. Furthermore, his lack of direct committee assignments related to space or science, combined with his focus on other legislative priorities like rural healthcare and education, may limit his immediate engagement with this issue.</p>
<p>However, there are tangible local benefits from NASA's science mission that could foster receptiveness. Companies and universities in his district, such as Planewave Instruments, Andrews University, and Albion College, have received nearly $1 million in NASA contracts and grants for astrophysics, planetary science, and heliophysics research over the past three years. Highlighting these direct economic and academic contributions, along with his general interest in science education, could provide a compelling argument for protecting and investing in NASA's science portfolio.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider highlighting the specific local economic and academic benefits of NASA science investments in his district, such as the contracts with Planewave Instruments in Adrian and grants to Andrews University and Albion College, demonstrating direct community impact.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's science missions inspire students and contribute to STEM workforce development, aligning with Representative Walberg's focus on improving science education as Chairman of the Education and Workforce Committee.</li>
<li>Look into framing increased NASA science investment as a fiscally responsible and high-return national investment, emphasizing innovation, technological leadership, and long-term societal benefits to address his concerns about government spending.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Tim Walberg</h2>
<ul>
<li>Graduated from Thornton Fractional North High School in 1969.</li>
<li>Briefly served with the U.S. Forest Service early in his career.</li>
<li>Served as a pastor at Grace Fellowship Church from 1973 to 1977.</li>
<li>Served in the Michigan House of Representatives from 1983 to 1998.</li>
<li>Worked as a division manager for the Moody Bible Institute.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local Industry Engagement:</strong> A company in Adrian, MI, Planewave Instruments Inc, received NASA contracts totaling $379K for telescope modification and prefabricated enclosures, indicating local economic benefit from NASA's astrophysics and planetary science activities. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Local Research Investment (Heliophysics/Earth Science):</strong> Andrews University in Berrien Springs, MI, received a $524K NASA grant for research on upward field-aligned currents and electron precipitation, demonstrating local academic involvement in NASA's heliophysics and Earth science goals. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Local Research Investment (Planetary Science):</strong> Albion College in Albion, MI, received a $124K NASA grant for research on lunar impact glasses, highlighting local academic contributions to NASA's planetary science objectives. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Engagement with NASA Authorization Legislation:</strong> Representative Walberg is listed in connection with S.933, the NASA Transition Authorization Act of 2025, which authorizes programs for NASA, indicating legislative engagement with the agency's overall mission and framework.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on Science Education:</strong> As Chairman of the Education and Workforce Committee, Representative Walberg issued a statement in September 2025 expressing concern over historic drops in national science test scores, suggesting an interest in strengthening foundational science education relevant to future scientific endeavors.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Opposition to Earth Science Funding (Climate Change Stance):</strong> Representative Walberg stated in 2017 that he believes God will "take care of" climate change, indicating a philosophical perspective that could limit support for human-driven climate science research within NASA's Earth Science Directorate. (TIME, 2017-05)</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism and Opposition to Government Spending:</strong> Walberg consistently advocates for reduced government spending, having supported recent measures like the "Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act" and the "Rescissions Act" to cut what he identifies as "wasteful spending," which may lead to scrutiny of increased NASA science budgets. (Congressman Tim Walberg, 2025-09; Dailymotion, 2025-07)</li>
<li><strong>Focus on National Security in Research:</strong> Walberg recently co-authored a report and supported the SAFE Research Act, aimed at preventing federal STEM funding from going to universities collaborating with foreign adversaries, indicating a strong emphasis on national security in research funding decisions. (Select Committee on the CCP, 2025-09)</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Direct Space-Related Committee Influence:</strong> Representative Walberg holds no current committee assignments directly related to space or science in the 119th Congress, which may limit his direct legislative influence on NASA's budget and policy. (Authoritative Committee Data)</li>
<li><strong>Competing Legislative Priorities:</strong> Walberg has recently championed significant investments in rural healthcare through the $50 billion Rural Health Transformation program and focused on education issues as Chairman of the House Education and Workforce Committee, potentially diverting his legislative focus from increased NASA science funding. (Quiver Quantitative, 2025-09; Congressman Tim Walberg, 2025-09)</li>
