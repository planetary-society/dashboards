    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.

<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Barrett's consistent advocacy for reduced federal spending and his skepticism towards climate-related investments suggest he may be resistant to increasing discretionary spending for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, particularly Earth science. His legislative priorities primarily center on national security, border security, and veterans' affairs, indicating that broader space science funding may not be a top concern for him.</p>
<p>However, there are significant local connections that could foster receptiveness. Michigan State University in his district receives substantial NASA grants for Earth science and ISS-related research, and Nikon Metrology, Inc. holds NASA contracts, demonstrating direct local economic and research benefits. Highlighting these district-specific investments and connecting NASA science to STEM education and advanced university research could provide a pathway for advocacy.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider highlighting how NASA science investments directly support jobs and innovation at Michigan State University and Nikon Metrology in his district, aligning with his interest in local economic development and STEM education.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's scientific research, particularly in areas like advanced materials or health in space, can yield technological advancements with practical benefits for veterans or national security, resonating with his military background.</li>
<li>Look into framing NASA's Earth science activities in terms of their direct benefits to Michigan, such as agricultural monitoring, water resource management, or severe weather prediction, rather than solely focusing on climate change, to address potential fiscal conservatism or climate-related skepticism.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Tom Barrett</h2>
<ul>
<li>Graduated from Western Michigan University with a political science degree.</li>
<li>Served 21 years in the U.S. Army and Michigan Army National Guard.</li>
<li>Veteran of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom.</li>
<li>Worked as an analyst for the Michigan Department of the Treasury.</li>
<li>Served in the Michigan House and Senate, chairing Transportation and Infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local NASA Research Investment:</strong> Michigan State University, located in his district, has received significant NASA grants for Earth science research and experiments related to the International Space Station, indicating a direct local stake in NASA's Science Mission Directorate activities. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Local Industry Supporting NASA:</strong> Nikon Metrology, Inc. in Brighton, MI, within his district, has been awarded NASA contracts for laser radar metrology systems and microscope upgrades, demonstrating local industry engagement with NASA's technological needs. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Support for STEM Education:</strong> Representative Barrett's office actively hosts the Congressional App Challenge for middle and high school students in MI-07, promoting participation in computer science and coding, which aligns with fostering future STEM talent. (House.gov, 2025-10)</li>
<li><strong>Engagement with University Research:</strong> He welcomed testimony from a Michigan State University College of Engineering professor at a House Veterans' Affairs Subcommittee hearing to discuss artificial intelligence applications, showing an interest in advanced university research and its practical benefits. (Rep. Tom Barrett Press Release, 2025-09)</li>
<li><strong>Facilitation of Federal Funding:</strong> His congressional office provides clear guidance and a formal process for constituents and local entities to submit programmatic, language, and community project funding requests for federal appropriations bills, indicating responsiveness to securing federal investments for the district. (House.gov, 2025-04)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Representative Barrett has consistently advocated for reducing federal spending and lowering taxes, as evidenced by his support for the "One Big Beautiful Bill" and other budget resolutions aimed at fiscal responsibility, which could limit enthusiasm for increased discretionary spending on NASA science.</li>
<li><strong>Skepticism of Climate-Related Spending:</strong> His vote in May 2025 for a budget reconciliation bill that repealed clean energy investments and tax credits and aimed to expand fossil fuel production suggests a policy stance that may be less supportive of NASA's Earth science activities, particularly those related to climate research.</li>
<li><strong>Dominant Focus on Other Priorities:</strong> Representative Barrett's public statements and legislative efforts primarily highlight national security, border security, economic issues, and veterans' affairs, indicating these as his core priorities, which may overshadow advocacy for increased NASA science and exploration funding.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Explicit Broader Space Advocacy:</strong> While his district benefits from NASA Earth science grants to Michigan State University, the public record does not show explicit statements or legislative actions from Representative Barrett actively championing broader NASA space science or exploration programs beyond these specific local ties [cite: contracts].</li>
