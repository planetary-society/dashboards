    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.
    All AI-generated claims, assessments, and recommendations should be independently verified.

<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology</li>
<li>Member, House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology: Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Stevens's position on the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee and its Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee indicates direct engagement with NASA's activities, and her recent opposition to federal science agency cuts suggests a general receptiveness to protecting research investments. Her co-chairmanship of the Women in STEM Caucus and support for the CHIPS and Science Act further highlight her commitment to STEM and R&amp;D, which are foundational to NASA's scientific endeavors.</p>
<p>While the total NASA science contracts in her district are modest, they include direct support for space science instrumentation, providing a local economic connection. Given her explicit record of defending science funding and her oversight role, Representative Stevens may be guardedly receptive to advocacy for increased NASA space science funding, especially when framed around its broader impact on innovation and the STEM pipeline.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching the specific NASA science contracts in her district, such as those with Rigaku Innovative Technologies or Altair Engineering, to highlight local jobs and economic benefits directly tied to NASA investment.</li>
<li>Explore how increased NASA science funding can directly support STEM education and workforce development initiatives in Michigan, particularly those benefiting women and underrepresented groups, aligning with her work on the Women in STEM Caucus.</li>
<li>Look into her recent statements and actions regarding federal science funding, including her opposition to cuts and support for the CHIPS and Science Act, to frame the request for NASA science investment as a continuation of her established policy priorities.</li>
</ul>
