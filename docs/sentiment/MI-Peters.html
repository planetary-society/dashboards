<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, Senate Committee on Appropriations</li>
<li>Member, Senate Committee on Appropriations: Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee</li>
<li>Member, Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Senator Peters holds a powerful position on the Senate Appropriations Committee and its CJS Subcommittee, giving him direct influence over NASA's budget, and he has previously co-sponsored legislation supporting critical science missions. Michigan institutions, particularly the University of Michigan, receive significant NASA science contracts for instruments vital to planetary science and heliophysics, which he has highlighted as contributing to "unprecedented scientific discoveries." However, his "no" vote on the CJS Appropriations bill in subcommittee, which funds NASA, indicates potential reservations or competing priorities that could complicate advocacy for increased science funding, especially given the proposed 47% cut in FY2026.</p>
<p>Despite this, Senator Peters has consistently advocated against budget cuts impacting NASA's science missions and emphasized the economic and national security benefits of space weather programs, aligning with Michigan's heliophysics research. Advocates should leverage his past support for federal research investment and the tangible benefits of NASA science contracts in Michigan to demonstrate how robust funding for the Science Mission Directorate directly supports local innovation and national leadership, potentially overcoming his prior reservations.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider highlighting specific NASA science projects at Michigan institutions, particularly the University of Michigan, and how these investments directly create jobs, foster innovation, and train the next generation of STEM professionals in the state.</li>
<li>Explore framing NASA's space science investments as critical for national security, economic competitiveness, and long-term innovation, aligning with Senator Peters' background in the Navy Reserve and his focus on commercial space and the CHIPS and Science Act.</li>
<li>Look into the specific reasons or context behind Senator Peters' "no" vote on the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (CJS) Appropriations bill in subcommittee to understand any underlying concerns that might impact his view on NASA science funding.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Gary C. Peters</h2>

</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Appropriations Committee Influence:</strong> As a member of the Senate Committee on Appropriations and its Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee, Senator Peters directly influences NASA's budget, having helped secure funding for "cutting-edge research" and the Artemis Mission in the Fiscal Year 2026 CJS Appropriations Act. This role allows him to advocate for Michigan institutions like the University of Michigan, which receives significant NASA contracts for science instruments, including those for planetary science and heliophysics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support for NASA Authorization and Science:</strong> Senator Peters co-sponsored the bipartisan NASA Transition Authorization Act of 2025, which aims to advance American leadership in deep space exploration and explicitly supports "critical science and exploration missions" including "vital life and physical science research" and the Planetary Defense Coordination Office. He stated that this bill would "help cement America's leadership in space exploration and the broader commercial space economy."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Advocacy Against Science Budget Cuts:</strong> Senator Peters has publicly questioned the impact of potential budget cuts on NASA's Moon and Mars missions and challenged proposed cuts to the Space Weather Prediction Center, emphasizing the critical role of space weather programs for national security and economic stability. The University of Michigan has NASA contracts related to heliophysics and solar wind, directly benefiting from robust space weather research.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Promoting Michigan's Aerospace Contributions:</strong> Senator Peters hosted NASA Administrator Bill Nelson in Michigan to highlight the state's aerospace manufacturing contributions to space exploration, emphasizing that these efforts enable "unprecedented scientific discoveries about our universe." This visit showcased Futuramic in Detroit and involved academics from Michigan universities, linking local industry and research to NASA's mission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>General Support for Science and Research Investment:</strong> Senator Peters has consistently advocated for federal investment in scientific research, as evidenced by his work on the CHIPS and Science Act to boost manufacturing and his visits to Michigan State University to highlight the importance of federal funding for research, stating, "you have to continually invest in this." Michigan universities are major recipients of federal research grants, including those from the National Science Foundation, which Peters has supported.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>Senator Gary C. Peters (D-MI) demonstrates a generally supportive posture toward NASA's Science Mission Directorate activities and exploration programs, often highlighting their economic and national security benefits for Michigan. However, some potential risk indicators can be identified:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of Direct STEM Background:</strong> Senator Peters' biography indicates a professional background in investment advising, law, and business, with no direct public record of STEM or space-related professional experience. This might suggest a reliance on economic and strategic arguments for space investment rather than an inherent scientific passion. (Biography)</li>
<li><strong>Focus on Commercial Space and Economic Competitiveness:</strong> While supportive of space, a significant portion of Senator Peters' recent legislative activity, such as the Commercial Space Activity Advisory Committee Act, emphasizes strengthening the commercial space sector and industry competitiveness. This focus, while beneficial, could potentially shift emphasis or resources away from purely scientific endeavors if not carefully balanced. (Senator Gary Peters Press Release, 2025-06-25; Congress.gov, 2025-02-05; ExecutiveGov, 2025-02-10)</li>
<li><strong>Prioritization of Michigan-Specific Economic Benefits:</strong> Senator Peters frequently highlights how NASA programs and federal science investments benefit Michigan's manufacturing sector and research institutions, including securing funding for the Artemis mission due to Michigan aerospace manufacturers. This strong emphasis on local economic impact, while a positive for advocacy, could potentially lead to a prioritization of projects with direct Michigan ties over broader scientific merit if budget constraints become severe. (Senator Gary Peters Press Release, 2024-07-23; Senator Gary Peters Press Release, 2025-07-18; USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Concerns over Federal Spending and Budget Cuts:</strong> Senator Peters has expressed concerns about potential federal funding cuts impacting scientific research and NASA missions, questioning nominees about the impact of budget cuts on Moon and Mars missions. While he has worked to secure funding and avoid cuts, the broader political dynamics around federal spending could still pose a risk to growing NASA science budgets. (Forbes Breaking News, 2025-04-10; Forbes Breaking News, 2025-09-13; WDET, 2025-05-19; The Washington Post, 2025-09-12)</li>
<li><strong>Vote Against CJS Appropriations Bill in Subcommittee:</strong> Senator Peters was recorded as a "no" vote on the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (CJS) Appropriations bill during a subcommittee markup. While the specific reasons for this vote are not detailed in the provided snippets, a "no" vote on a bill that includes funding for NASA and science agencies could be interpreted as a risk indicator, depending on the underlying reasons for his opposition. (Forbes Breaking News, 2025-07-17; POLITICO Pro, 2025-07-09)</li>
