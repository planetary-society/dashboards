    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.
    All AI-generated claims, assessments, and recommendations should be independently verified.

<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Morrison's receptiveness to increased NASA space science funding is likely to be tempered by her primary legislative focus on healthcare and her lack of direct committee assignments related to space. While her district benefits from NASA contracts, such as Proto Labs' "Viper fabrication services," these are largely for manufacturing and services rather than direct Science Mission Directorate research grants, and there is no public record of her explicit advocacy for NASA science funding.</p>
<p>However, her strong medical and scientific background, coupled with her past opposition to general research funding cuts and her emphasis on science-informed policy, suggests a potential openness to the value of scientific investment. Her district's existing, albeit indirect, ties to NASA through contracts provide a tangible connection that advocates can leverage, offering a foundation for engagement despite space science not being her stated top priority.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching specific examples of how NASA's space science discoveries or technological advancements have broader scientific impacts that align with the fundamental research and innovation she champions in the medical field. This can help frame space science as a vital part of the scientific progress she supports.</li>
<li>Look into the specific contributions of companies like Proto Labs in Maple Plain to NASA's planetary science missions, highlighting how these contracts support high-tech jobs and foster innovation directly within her district. This connects NASA investment to local economic benefits and her interest in R&amp;D.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's space science activities, including Earth science, contribute to understanding global challenges or inspire STEM education and workforce development within Minnesota's 3rd district. This can help connect space science to broader societal benefits and future scientific talent.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Kelly Morrison</h2>
<ul>
<li>Graduated cum laude from Yale; earned Doctor of Medicine from Case Western Reserve University.</li>
<li>Practicing obstetrician-gynecologist (OB-GYN), providing a strong medical and science background.</li>
<li>Served in the Minnesota House of Representatives (2019-2023) and Minnesota Senate (2023-2024).</li>
<li>Joined the House's Democratic Doctors' Caucus, emphasizing her medical and scientific expertise.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Medical and Scientific Background:</strong> Representative Morrison's background as a practicing obstetrician-gynecologist with a Doctor of Medicine degree and her membership in the Democratic Doctors' Caucus indicate a strong appreciation for scientific research and evidence-based policy.</li>
<li><strong>District's Direct Involvement in NASA Science:</strong> Companies in her district, such as Proto Labs, Inc. in Maple Plain, received a NASA contract for "Viper fabrication services," directly supporting NASA's planetary science exploration. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for Research and Innovation Funding:</strong> She introduced the SBIR/STTR Application Assistance Act and the bipartisan DOE and SBA Research Act to encourage small businesses, including those in her district, to engage in research and development, supporting American innovation and scientific achievement.</li>
<li><strong>Opposition to Research Funding Cuts:</strong> Representative Morrison publicly opposed cuts to NIH research funding, stating, "We should be moving forward, trying to make progress with our research and innovation â€” not backward," indicating a general stance against reductions in scientific investment.</li>
<li><strong>Bipartisan Support for Science-Informed Policy:</strong> Her cosponsorship of the bipartisan Focus on Learning Act, which requires a study on cell phone effects on students, highlights her belief in being "guided by the science and the facts" for policy decisions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of Space-Related Committee Assignments:</strong> Representative Morrison does not hold any current space-related committee assignments in the 119th Congress, which may limit her direct engagement and influence on NASA's space science and exploration policy and funding. (Authoritative Committee Data, 2025-09-23)</li>
<li><strong>Primary Legislative Focus on Healthcare:</strong> Her professional background as an OB-GYN and consistent public statements highlight healthcare as a top legislative priority, indicating potential competing demands for her attention and advocacy.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Direct NASA Space Science Research Ties:</strong> While her district benefits from NASA contracts for services and fabrication, there is no public record of significant NASA Science Mission Directorate research grants to academic institutions or research organizations within MN-03. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Absence of Explicit NASA Space Science Advocacy:</strong> Public records from the last 24 months do not explicitly highlight Representative Morrison's advocacy for increased investment in NASA's space science activities. (No public record found, 2025-09-23)</li>
