<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Fischbach's fiscal conservatism and lack of direct committee influence present significant challenges for advocating increased NASA space science funding, especially given the proposed FY26 cuts. Her opposition to broad spending bills and skepticism towards certain Earth science initiatives further suggest a cautious approach to federal outlays.</p>
<p>However, her support for R&amp;D tax incentives, STEM education, and engagement with local technology firms like Digi-Key Corp, which has received a small NASA contract, indicate potential receptiveness to the economic and workforce benefits of scientific investment. Advocates should focus on how NASA science programs contribute to technological innovation and STEM workforce development, aligning with her stated priorities, rather than broad spending increases.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider discussing how NASA's science investments drive broader technological innovation and R&amp;D, which could benefit companies like Digi-Key and the manufacturing sector in her district, aligning with her support for R&amp;D tax incentives.</li>
<li>Explore how increased investment in NASA's space science activities directly strengthens the STEM workforce pipeline and creates educational opportunities, resonating with her past co-sponsorship of STEM education legislation.</li>
<li>Look into framing NASA science funding as a strategic federal investment that yields significant returns, potentially identifying how local institutions or businesses in MN-07 could benefit from related research or educational initiatives, aligning with her engagement in Community Project Funding.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Michelle Fischbach</h2>
<ul>
<li>Holds a Bachelor of Arts in political science and economics.</li>
<li>Earned a Juris Doctor degree, practicing as an attorney.</li>
<li>Served on Paynesville City Council and in the Minnesota Senate for over two decades.</li>
<li>Was President of the Minnesota Senate from 2011-2013 and 2017-2018.</li>
<li>Served as Lieutenant Governor of Minnesota from 2018 to 2019.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Support for R&amp;D Tax Incentives:</strong> Representative Fischbach has supported legislation and policies promoting research and development (R&amp;D) tax expensing for businesses, which can foster innovation relevant to scientific and technological advancement. Her office noted that such policies would preserve $23 million per year in R&amp;D-related wages in Minnesota. (House.gov, 2024-03-06; IQ Connect, 2025-06-29; BillTrack50, 2025)</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for STEM Education:</strong> She co-sponsored the "STEM Opportunities Act" (H.R.204) and the "Supporting STEM Learning Opportunities Act" (S.1565) in the 117th Congress, demonstrating support for initiatives to strengthen the STEM workforce pipeline. While not explicitly tied to a specific local institution in the bill text, strengthening STEM education benefits all districts by preparing a skilled workforce. (Congress.gov, 2021-05)</li>
<li><strong>Engagement with Local Technology Sector:</strong> Representative Fischbach's district includes Digi-Key Corp, a major electronic components distributor, and she has engaged with local manufacturing businesses, indicating an understanding of the technology sector's importance. Digi-Key Corp in Thief River Falls, MN, is a significant employer in her district, and she visited Marine Innovations in Frazee, MN, in January 2024. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024; House.gov, 2024-01-04; Wikipedia, 2023)</li>
<li><strong>Bipartisan Collaboration on Workforce Development:</strong> She co-sponsored the bipartisan "Rebuild America's Health Care Schools Act" in March 2025, demonstrating a willingness to work across the aisle on legislation to address specialized workforce shortages and support educational programs. The legislation aims to allow training in smaller facilities, including those across western Minnesota. (House.gov, 2025-03-05)</li>
<li><strong>Engagement in Community Project Funding:</strong> Her office actively solicits and supports Community Project Funding requests for the 7th District, providing a mechanism for local entities, including potential research or educational institutions, to seek federal investment. This process directly targets projects within Minnesota's 7th District. (House.gov, 2025-04-20)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Representative Fischbach consistently advocates for reducing federal spending and implementing "Zero Based Budgeting," indicating a general skepticism toward increased government outlays that could impact NASA science and exploration funding.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Direct Committee Influence:</strong> Representative Fischbach holds no current space-related committee assignments in the 119th Congress, limiting her direct legislative influence on NASA's budget and policy.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Local NASA Economic Ties:</strong> No relevant NASA Science Mission Directorate contracts or grants were found for Minnesota's 7th Congressional District, suggesting a lack of direct economic incentive for increased NASA science investment in her constituency. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Opposition to Broad Spending Bills:</strong> She has voted against large appropriations packages, including the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2022 and the CHIPS Act, citing concerns about overall government spending, even when such bills include science-related funding.</li>
<li><strong>Skepticism Towards Certain Earth Science Initiatives:</strong> Representative Fischbach has expressed opposition to "Green New Deal initiatives" and supported efforts to defund programs related to "environmental justice activities" within federal agencies, which may indicate reluctance to support Earth science programs perceived as linked to climate change policy.</li>
