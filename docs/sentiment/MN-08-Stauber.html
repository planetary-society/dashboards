<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Stauber's strong fiscal conservatism, demonstrated by his support for federal spending cuts, and his focus on resource extraction present significant challenges for advocating increased NASA science funding. His lack of direct space policy committee assignments also suggests this may not be a primary focus, especially given the proposed 47% cut to the Science Mission Directorate.</p>
<p>However, the presence of NASA science grants within his district for Earth science and climate education offers a direct local connection and potential avenue for engagement. His general support for scientific research and active pursuit of federal funding for district projects indicate a guarded optimism that he may be receptive if NASA's science mission is clearly linked to local economic benefits, educational opportunities, and scientific advancement.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider highlighting the specific NASA science grants at the University of Minnesota Duluth and Fond Du Lac Tribal and Community College, emphasizing how these investments directly benefit local education and research within his district.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA science investments, especially those with local connections, can be framed as fiscally responsible federal funding opportunities that his office actively seeks for district projects.</li>
<li>Look into connecting NASA's broader scientific endeavors to his demonstrated support for scientific research, such as medical research for Down syndrome, by illustrating how fundamental science drives innovation and provides critical data for public benefit.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Pete Stauber</h2>
<ul>
<li>Graduated from Lake Superior State University with a bachelor's degree in criminology.</li>
<li>Retired as a lieutenant from the Duluth Police Department after 23 years of service.</li>
<li>Served as a St. Louis County Commissioner and on the Hermantown City Council.</li>

<li>Advocates for continuing medical research on Down syndrome; received an advocacy award.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Support for Earth Science research:</strong> A NASA grant for barotropic and baroclinic tide models supporting the SWOT mission was awarded to the Regents of the University of Minnesota in Duluth, within his district, indicating direct local benefit from NASA's Earth Science activities. Local connection: University of Minnesota, Duluth, MN (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024).</li>
<li><strong>Support for Climate Education and Research:</strong> A NASA grant for cooperative climate education and research was awarded to Fond Du Lac Tribal and Community College in Cloquet, within his district, demonstrating local engagement with NASA's Earth Science and Biological and Physical Sciences initiatives. Local connection: Fond Du Lac Tribal and Community College, Cloquet, MN (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024).</li>
<li><strong>Active pursuit of federal funding for district projects:</strong> Representative Stauber's office actively solicits and submits requests for Community Project Funding and programmatic appropriations for his district, demonstrating a mechanism for advocating for federal investment in local initiatives. Local connection: His office provides forms for FY26 Community Project Funding and Programmatic Appropriations Requests (House.gov, undated).</li>
<li><strong>Bipartisan advocacy for increased education funding:</strong> Representative Stauber has co-led bipartisan letters urging increased federal appropriations for Head Start in Fiscal Years 2024 and 2025, indicating a willingness to advocate for federal investment in educational programs. (NHSA, 2023, 2024)</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for scientific research:</strong> Representative Stauber advocates for continuing medical research on Down syndrome, demonstrating a general appreciation for and support of scientific research to address societal challenges. (Biography)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Representative Stauber voted for the Recissions Act of 2025, which aimed to cut $9 billion in federal spending, and expressed support for future rescission packages, indicating a strong focus on reducing government expenditures that could impact NASA's budget. (Quiver Quantitative, 2025-07)</li>
<li><strong>Prioritization of Resource Extraction:</strong> Stauber consistently advocates for expanding mining and energy development, introducing legislation to overturn mining bans and expedite permitting processes, which may lead to a lower prioritization of certain NASA Earth science activities perceived as conflicting with these economic interests. (CBS News, 2024-12; Lakeland News, 2025-02)</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Direct Space Policy Role:</strong> Representative Stauber does not hold any current space-related committee assignments, which may limit his direct engagement or influence on NASA's Science Mission Directorate and exploration programs. (space_committees, 2025-09-23)</li>
<li><strong>Skepticism towards Environmental Regulations:</strong> His legislative actions and public statements frequently challenge environmental regulations and the authority of agencies when they impact resource development, potentially leading to a cautious view of NASA Earth science initiatives that inform such regulations. (House.gov, 2025-02; MPR News, 2025-08)</li>
