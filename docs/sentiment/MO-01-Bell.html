<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Bell's direct influence on NASA's budget is limited as he does not sit on the House Science, Space, and Technology or Appropriations Committees. His public record also indicates a primary focus on criminal justice reform and local economic development, suggesting that increased NASA science funding may not be a top legislative priority. While he has supported general NASA reauthorization, there is no explicit record of him advocating for a significant expansion of the Science Mission Directorate's budget.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, there are strong opportunities for engagement. His district benefits significantly from over $27 million in NASA science grants to Washington University, providing a clear economic and scientific tie-in. His co-sponsorship of the NASA Reauthorization Act and National Space Day, coupled with his engagement with science advocates and platform emphasis on science and environmental protection, indicates a positive general disposition towards NASA's mission. Advocates should highlight the direct local impact and align science funding with his appreciation for scientific advancement and environmental stewardship.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider highlighting the specific NASA science grants received by Washington University in St. Louis, detailing how these projects contribute to local job creation, scientific innovation, and educational opportunities within his district.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's Earth science initiatives directly align with Representative Bell's stated commitment to "protecting our planet by fighting climate change," providing examples of how this research benefits Missouri's environment and economy.</li>
<li>Look into sharing compelling personal stories from constituents whose careers or educational paths have been inspired or supported by NASA science, encouraging him to champion federal science funding as a broader investment in the nation's future.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Wesley Bell</h2>
<ul>
<li>Holds degrees from Lindenwood University and University of Missouri School of Law.</li>
<li>Worked as a public defender, municipal prosecutor, and municipal judge.</li>
<li>Served as a criminology professor at Florissant Valley Community College.</li>
<li>Elected to Ferguson City Council in 2015.</li>
<li>Served as St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney from 2019 to 2025.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>District Benefits from NASA Science Investment:</strong> Washington University in St. Louis, located within Representative Bell's district, receives substantial NASA grants totaling over $27 million for planetary science, astrophysics, and space instrumentation, demonstrating a direct economic and scientific benefit to his constituency. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Support for NASA Reauthorization:</strong> Representative Bell co-sponsored the NASA Reauthorization Act of 2024 (H.R.8958), which reauthorizes NASA's programs, including space exploration, research, and technology, and specifically addresses Earth science and monitoring capabilities. This indicates legislative support for NASA's overall mission and science activities. (Congress.gov, 2024-09)</li>
<li><strong>Commemoration of National Space Day:</strong> Representative Bell co-sponsored a resolution commemorating May 2, 2025, as National Space Day, acknowledging NASA's groundbreaking missions and the contributions of universities and private companies to space achievements. This suggests a positive general disposition towards space exploration and scientific endeavors. (Congressional Record, 2025-05)</li>
<li><strong>Engagement with Science Advocates:</strong> Representative Bell's office engaged with a Washington University graduate student in April 2025 during Congressional Visit Days, discussing the importance of federal science funding, including NASA programs like Landsat, and the economic benefits of basic science research. This demonstrates an openness to understanding and considering science advocacy. (Washington University, 2025-05)</li>
<li><strong>Platform Emphasis on Science and Environmental Protection:</strong> Representative Bell's campaign platform includes "protecting our planet by fighting climate change," which aligns with NASA's Earth science activities, and his first House floor speech highlighted contributions in "science, medicine and engineering," indicating a general appreciation for scientific fields. (Wesley Bell for Congress, undated; YouTube, 2025-02)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of Direct Committee Influence:</strong> Representative Bell does not hold a seat on the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee or the House Appropriations Committee, which are key for NASA's budget and policy, limiting his direct legislative influence over NASA's science and exploration programs. (House.gov, 2025-01-15; Congress.gov, 2025-01-03)</li>
<li><strong>Competing Legislative Priorities:</strong> Representative Bell's public record highlights a primary focus on criminal justice reform through his "Justice Forward Agenda" and local economic development initiatives like the "Gateway Partnership Act," indicating other legislative priorities may take precedence over space policy. (KSDK, 2025-04-11; Public, 2025-09-11; St. Louis American, 2025-09-22)</li>
<li><strong>Limited Explicit Advocacy for Increased NASA Investment:</strong> While Representative Bell co-sponsored the NASA Reauthorization Act of 2024, which outlines NASA's programs, there is no recent public record of him explicitly advocating for <em>increased</em> funding or a significant expansion of NASA's Science Mission Directorate or exploration activities. (Congress.gov, 2024-09-23)</li>
