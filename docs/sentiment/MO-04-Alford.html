<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Appropriations</li>
<li>Member, House Committee on Appropriations: Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Alford's strong fiscal conservative stance and focus on reducing federal spending suggest he may be resistant to increasing NASA's overall budget, especially given the proposed deep cuts to science. His district currently receives no direct NASA Science contracts or grants, limiting a clear economic incentive, and he has prioritized other local needs like rural healthcare and agriculture. Furthermore, his skepticism towards climate-related advocacy could make certain Earth science initiatives a harder sell.</p>
<p>However, his position on the House Appropriations CJS Subcommittee provides a direct avenue for advocacy, as he directly influences NASA's budget. Advocates can emphasize how NASA science drives innovation and future economic growth, aligning with his stated commitment to bringing new jobs and businesses to Missouri. The presence of university space programs in his district, even without direct NASA Science funding, indicates a local interest base that could be leveraged to demonstrate broader community support for these vital scientific endeavors.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching specific projects, student achievements, or faculty research within the University of Missouri-Columbia's Mizzou Space Program or Physics and Astronomy department that align with NASA science, to highlight local innovation and workforce development potential.</li>
<li>Explore how investments in NASA's space science activities contribute to broader economic growth, technological innovation, and STEM workforce development in Missouri, even without direct contracts, to address fiscal concerns and emphasize state benefits.</li>
<li>Look into Representative Alford's recent public statements or legislative priorities concerning federal spending, innovation, or education to tailor your message to his established interests and communication style, ensuring a more impactful and relevant discussion.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Mark Alford</h2>
<ul>
<li>Former television news anchor for over two decades in major markets.</li>
<li>Professional background is primarily in broadcast journalism.</li>
<li>Attended the University of Texas at Austin.</li>
<li>No military service or direct STEM/space industry experience is noted.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Direct Budgetary Influence:</strong> As a member of the House Appropriations Committee and its Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee, Representative Alford directly participates in decisions regarding NASA's budget, including its Science Mission Directorate. (Congressman Mark Alford, 2025-01; American Association of Museums, N.D.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Focus on State Economic Growth and Innovation:</strong> Representative Alford has publicly stated his commitment to bringing "new jobs, businesses, and innovation to Missouri" and ensuring the state has "a seat at the table" in funding decisions. (Missourinet, 2024-12)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Local University Space/Science Programs:</strong> The University of Missouri-Columbia, located partially within his district, hosts the Mizzou Space Program and a Physics and Astronomy department with astrophysics research, and is a partner in the NASA Missouri Space Grant Consortium, indicating local interest and capacity in space science. (University of Missouri, 2023-Fall; University of Missouri, 2025-09; NASA Missouri Space Grant Consortium, N.D.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support for Stable Government Funding:</strong> Representative Alford supported a clean continuing resolution to fund the federal government, emphasizing the necessity of keeping the government operational and avoiding shutdowns. (Congressman Mark Alford, 2025-09; Quiver Quantitative, 2025-09)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Representative Alford consistently advocates for fiscal responsibility, reducing federal spending, and cutting waste, which may lead to resistance against increasing NASA's overall budget.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Direct Local NASA Science Economic Ties:</strong> No public record of NASA Science Mission Directorate contracts or grants in Missouri's 4th Congressional District indicates a lack of direct local economic incentive to prioritize these specific programs. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Competing District Priorities:</strong> Representative Alford has prioritized securing federal investments for rural healthcare, infrastructure, agriculture, and military installations within his district, suggesting these may take precedence over broader space science initiatives.</li>
<li><strong>Skepticism towards Climate-Related Science Advocacy:</strong> Representative Alford has expressed concerns about "radical climate activists" influencing science policy, which could translate to skepticism or resistance regarding certain NASA Earth science activities perceived as aligned with a specific climate agenda.</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on Reducing Federal Footprint and Bureaucracy:</strong> His support for decentralizing federal agencies and calls to reduce "underutilized" federal buildings and "bureaucrats" suggest a general inclination to scrutinize federal agency spending and administrative structures, including NASA's.</li>
