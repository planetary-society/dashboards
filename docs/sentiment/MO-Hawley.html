<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Senator Hawley's receptiveness to increased NASA space science funding is uncertain, given his lack of direct committee assignments related to space and his consistent fiscal conservatism, including opposition to large spending bills and earmarks. While he emphasizes American innovation and national competitiveness, which aligns with NASA's mission, his skepticism towards federal funding overhead and prioritization of economic issues over climate initiatives could pose challenges, particularly for Earth science funding.</p>
<p>However, the significant NASA science grants received by Missouri institutions, totaling over $37 million in recent years, particularly by Washington University and the University of Missouri System, directly support research and jobs within his state. Highlighting how increased science funding translates to direct research investment and strengthens Missouri's role in cutting-edge technology and STEM could resonate with his stated focus on American leadership and directing funds to actual research rather than administrative costs.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider highlighting specific NASA science grants received by institutions like Washington University and the University of Missouri, detailing how these investments directly support high-tech jobs, cutting-edge research, and STEM education within Missouri.</li>
<li>Explore framing increased NASA science investment as crucial for maintaining American technological leadership and national security, aligning with Senator Hawley's consistent focus on U.S. innovation and global competitiveness.</li>
<li>Look into emphasizing how direct investment in NASA's Science Mission Directorate supports fundamental research, which aligns with Senator Hawley's expressed preference for federal funding to be directed towards actual research rather than administrative overhead.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Josh Hawley</h2>

</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local NASA Science Investment:</strong> Missouri institutions receive substantial NASA grants for science activities, directly supporting research and jobs in the state. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for American Innovation:</strong> Senator Hawley consistently emphasizes American leadership in technology and innovation, particularly in the context of global competition, which aligns with NASA's role in advancing cutting-edge science and technology. (Josh Hawley, 2025-09-04), (Josh Hawley, 2025-04-03)</li>
<li><strong>Focus on Direct Research Funding:</strong> Senator Hawley has expressed that federal funding should be directed towards actual research rather than administrative overhead, suggesting a potential alignment with prioritizing direct science program investments. (Missourinet, 2025-02-14)</li>
<li><strong>Bipartisan Engagement on Technology:</strong> Senator Hawley has engaged in bipartisan efforts on technology-related legislation, such as with Senator Blumenthal on AI and intellectual property, indicating a capacity for cross-party collaboration on science and technology initiatives. (Kansas City Star, 2024-09-16), (Josh Hawley, 2025-07-16)</li>
<li><strong>National Competitiveness through STEM:</strong> Senator Hawley's broader concern for American national security and competitiveness, often framed in terms of technological leadership, could extend to maintaining U.S. preeminence in space science and exploration, which relies on a strong STEM foundation. (Josh Hawley, 2025-09-04)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Lack of Direct Space-Related Committee Assignments:</strong> Senator Hawley does not hold any current committee assignments directly related to space or science, which may limit his direct engagement and influence on NASA's Science Mission Directorate activities and exploration programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fiscal Conservatism and Opposition to Earmarks:</strong> Senator Hawley has consistently voted against large spending bills and refuses to participate in congressionally directed spending (earmarks), citing concerns about government overspending and corruption, which could limit his support for increased federal funding for specific projects, including those for NASA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Skepticism Towards Federal Research Funding Overhead:</strong> Senator Hawley has publicly defended efforts to limit federal funding for university overhead expenses, suggesting a preference for direct research spending over administrative costs, which could impact the financial models of institutions receiving NASA grants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Prioritization of Economic and National Security Concerns over Climate Agenda:</strong> Senator Hawley has criticized the Biden Administration's "climate agenda," stating that the "overriding crisis" is the wages and jobs of American workers, indicating a potential prioritization of economic issues over climate-related scientific endeavors, which could affect Earth science funding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Opposition to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Initiatives in Federal Grants:</strong> Senator Hawley has expressed concerns and sought information regarding federal agencies, including NASA, contracting with DEI consulting firms, and has defended directives to review grants to ensure they are not awarded based on DEI criteria, which could impact broader NASA initiatives.</p>
