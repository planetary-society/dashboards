<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation</li>
<li>Member, Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation: Aviation, Space, and Innovation Subcommittee</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Senator Schmitt's direct involvement on the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee and its Aviation, Space, and Innovation Subcommittee, along with his co-sponsorship of the bipartisan NASA Transition Authorization Act of 2025, indicates a foundational understanding and general support for NASA's mission, including science and exploration. His emphasis on leveraging U.S. innovation and R&amp;D for space dominance aligns with the outcomes of scientific discovery, and the substantial NASA science grants awarded to Missouri institutions for planetary science, lunar research, and astrophysics provide a strong local economic and research benefit that advocates can highlight.</p>
<p>However, Senator Schmitt's fiscal conservatism and concerns about government spending may lead to reluctance for increased discretionary funding. He has also expressed opposition to NASA's focus on climate-related initiatives, which could impact support for Earth science, and has criticized DEI spending. Advocates will need to clearly articulate how increased science funding directly contributes to innovation, economic growth, and American leadership, particularly in light of the proposed FY2026 budget cuts, to overcome his skepticism regarding agency priorities and overall spending.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching specific success stories or spin-off technologies from the NASA science grants at Washington University and the University of Missouri System, highlighting how these investments translate into local jobs, STEM workforce development, and economic benefits for Missouri.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's foundational science research, particularly in areas like astrophysics and planetary science, directly underpins technological innovation, fuels the commercial space sector, and contributes to U.S. national security and global competitiveness.</li>
<li>Look into how increased investment in NASA's science activities can be presented as a fiscally responsible, long-term investment that yields significant returns through scientific discovery, technological advancement, and the training of a highly skilled workforce, aligning with principles of efficient government spending.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Eric Schmitt</h2>
<ul>
<li>Graduated from Truman State University (BA, Political Science) and Saint Louis University (JD).</li>
<li>Practiced law as a partner at the firm Lathrop &amp; Gage, LLP.</li>
<li>Served as Missouri State Senator, State Treasurer, and Attorney General.</li>
<li>Current legislative work involves science, space, and innovation policy.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Key Committee Assignment:</strong> Senator Schmitt serves as a Member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, and its Aviation, Space, and Innovation Subcommittee, which has direct oversight of NASA and national and civil space policy, indicating a direct role in shaping space legislation and funding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bipartisan NASA Authorization Support:</strong> Senator Schmitt co-sponsored the bipartisan NASA Transition Authorization Act of 2025 (S.933), which authorizes $25.478 billion for NASA in FY2025 and supports American leadership in space, including critical science and exploration missions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Advocacy for Space Innovation and R&amp;D:</strong> During a May 2023 Senate hearing on NASA's FY2024 budget, Senator Schmitt emphasized leveraging U.S. innovation and research and development to maintain American space dominance, noting that over 20 Missouri-based companies support the Artemis mission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support for Commercial Space Sector:</strong> Senator Schmitt co-sponsored the Commercial Standards Paramount to Accelerating Cosmic Exploration (SPACE) Leadership Act (S.4064) in March 2024, aiming to extend the FAA's learning period for commercial human spaceflight, which fosters private sector growth and partnerships relevant to NASA's exploration goals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Significant Local NASA Science Grants:</strong> Missouri institutions, including Washington University in St. Louis and the University of Missouri System, have received substantial NASA grants totaling over $29 million for planetary data systems, lunar research, origins-of-life studies, and astrophysics instruments, demonstrating direct local benefits from NASA's Science Mission Directorate. [cite: contracts]</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Opposition to Climate-Related Initiatives:</strong> Senator Schmitt has expressed concerns that NASA's focus on climate change and greenhouse gas emission disclosure requirements politicizes the agency and distracts from its core mission, potentially impacting support for Earth science funding.</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Senator Schmitt consistently advocates for reducing government spending and addressing the national debt, which may lead to general reluctance to support increased discretionary spending for federal agencies, including NASA science.</li>
<li><strong>Prioritization of Commercial Space and National Security:</strong> Senator Schmitt emphasizes leveraging the commercial space industry and maintaining American space dominance against adversaries like China, which could lead to a preference for programs with direct commercial or national security applications over pure science initiatives.</li>
<li><strong>Opposition to DEI Initiatives:</strong> Senator Schmitt has criticized NASA's spending on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, arguing they are "misguided woke policies" that divert resources from the agency's primary objectives.</li>
<li><strong>Rejection of Earmarks:</strong> Senator Schmitt's refusal to participate in congressionally directed spending (earmarks) limits a direct mechanism for advocates to secure specific federal funding for in-state NASA science projects.</li>
