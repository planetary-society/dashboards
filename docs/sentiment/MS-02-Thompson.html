    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.

<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Thompson's direct influence on NASA's science budget is limited, as he does not hold assignments on relevant space or appropriations committees. His primary legislative focus as Ranking Member of Homeland Security, coupled with a relatively low level of direct NASA Science Mission Directorate funding in his district, suggests that advocating for increased space science investment may not be a top priority. Furthermore, his expressed concerns about federal budget cuts could make him cautious about supporting new spending initiatives, especially given the proposed 47% cut to NASA science in FY2026.</p>
<p>However, there is a guarded optimism for engagement. The Representative consistently champions federal grants for STEM research and capacity building at local Historically Black Colleges and Universities, including a recent NASA-funded grant to Jackson State University for space applications. This demonstrates an appreciation for federal science investment and its role in local innovation and workforce development, providing an avenue to connect increased NASA science funding to tangible benefits for his constituents and the broader scientific community.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider highlighting the $401K NASA grant to Jackson State University for space applications, connecting increased NASA science investment directly to local economic and educational benefits within his district.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's science missions, particularly in Earth science or technology development, could align with his past advocacy for minority health and health care disparities, or broader STEM education and workforce development goals for HBCUs.</li>
<li>Look into how your personal story or the stories of others in your community connect to the benefits of space science, emphasizing how these investments support the educational and economic opportunities he frequently champions for his constituents.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local NASA-funded Space Research:</strong> Representative Thompson's district benefits from a $401K NASA grant to Jackson State University for high-density capacitive energy storage research for space applications, indicating direct local investment in space science and technology. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for STEM Research Funding:</strong> He consistently announces significant National Science Foundation (NSF) awards to local Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), including Jackson State University, for advanced research and STEM education initiatives, demonstrating support for federal science investment. (Congressman Bennie Thompson, 2025-07-25; Congressman Bennie Thompson, 2025-06-13; Congressman Bennie Thompson, 2024-08-29)</li>
<li><strong>Commitment to Scientific Innovation:</strong> Press releases from his office frequently emphasize that federal grants to local institutions advance scientific innovation and strengthen STEM education and workforce development, aligning with the goals of NASA's science mission. (Congressman Bennie Thompson, 2025-06-13; Congressman Bennie Thompson, 2025-07-25)</li>
<li><strong>Support for Higher Education Research Capacity:</strong> His announcements of NSF awards to Jackson State University and Tougaloo College specifically mention expanding research capacity at HBCUs, which fosters a robust scientific ecosystem relevant to NASA's needs. (Congressman Bennie Thompson, 2025-07-09; Congressman Bennie Thompson, 2025-06-13)</li>
<li><strong>General Support for Federal Science Investment:</strong> His consistent public announcements of federal science and research grants to institutions within his district, even beyond NASA, indicate a general posture of supporting federal investment in scientific endeavors. (Congressman Bennie Thompson, 2025-07-25; Congressman Bennie Thompson, 2025-06-12; Congressman Bennie Thompson, 2025-07-09)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of Direct Congressional Influence:</strong> Representative Thompson holds no current space-related committee assignments in the 119th Congress, limiting his direct legislative and oversight power over NASA's budget and policy. [cite: space_committees]</li>
<li><strong>Competing Legislative Priorities:</strong> As the Ranking Member of the House Homeland Security Committee, Representative Thompson's primary legislative focus is on national security, cybersecurity, and emergency management, which may divert attention from space science advocacy.</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on Local Economic and Social Programs:</strong> Representative Thompson's public record frequently highlights securing federal grants for local infrastructure, transportation, health care, and education, indicating a strong focus on immediate district needs.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Direct NASA Science Ties:</strong> While his district has received a grant for "space application" research, Representative Thompson's public record does not indicate extensive or direct engagement with NASA's Science Mission Directorate activities or a broad range of space science-specific economic ties. [cite: contracts, 8]</li>
<li><strong>Concerns Regarding Federal Budget Cuts:</strong> Representative Thompson has expressed concerns about federal budget cuts impacting essential services and lower-income constituents in his district, which may lead to caution regarding increased federal spending in other areas.</li>
