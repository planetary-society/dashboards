    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.

<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Appropriations</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Zinke's background in geology and past statements on "America's new space race" suggest a foundational appreciation for scientific endeavors and strategic space leadership. His district also benefits substantially from NASA Science Mission Directorate investments, with over $30 million in contracts and grants over the last three years, including significant funding for Montana State University in planetary, heliophysics, and Earth sciences. While he voted for the overall NASA appropriations bill in 2024, his strong fiscal conservatism and past skepticism regarding Earth science and climate change present significant challenges to advocating for increased NASA science funding, particularly given the context of proposed deep cuts.</p>
<p>Advocates may find receptiveness by emphasizing the direct economic benefits and job creation from local NASA science contracts, and how these investments contribute to American leadership in space and scientific innovation. While his focus on fiscal responsibility and past views on Earth science may require careful navigation, highlighting the non-Earth science components of NASA's portfolio and the tangible local impact could provide a pathway for productive engagement regarding the importance of robust NASA science funding.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching the specific local jobs and economic activity generated by NASA science contracts and grants in Montana, particularly those with S&amp;K Engineering and Montana State University, to highlight direct constituent benefits and return on investment.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's planetary science missions, such as those studying icy moons or solar phenomena, align with Representative Zinke's geology background and his stated interest in American leadership in space, framing scientific discovery as a strategic national endeavor.</li>
<li>Look into specific examples of how NASA Earth science data and technologies, like those from Montana State University's Freeze/Thaw research, provide practical benefits for Montana's agriculture, resource management, or disaster preparedness, emphasizing data utility over climate change implications.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Ryan K. Zinke</h2>

</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scientific Background:</strong> Representative Zinke holds a Bachelor of Science degree in geology, indicating a foundational understanding of scientific principles, particularly relevant to Earth and planetary sciences. His past statement calling climate change "America's new space race" suggests a strategic view of scientific endeavors in space. (Biography)</li>
<li><strong>Local NASA Science Investments:</strong> His district benefits from substantial NASA Science Mission Directorate contracts and grants, including over $10 million to Montana State University for projects in planetary science, heliophysics, and Earth science. Other local companies also received contracts for Earth science technologies. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Support for NASA Appropriations:</strong> As a member of the House Committee on Appropriations, Representative Zinke voted in favor of H.R. 5893, the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2024, which included funding for NASA. This vote indicates support for the agency's overall budget.</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for American Space Leadership:</strong> Representative Zinke has publicly expressed support for maintaining "American leadership in space," which broadly aligns with the goals of a robust NASA, including its science and exploration programs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Skepticism towards Earth Science:</strong> As former Interior Secretary, Representative Zinke expressed skepticism regarding the extent of human influence on climate change and oversaw policies that rescinded climate change planning and reportedly sought to edit scientific research to remove references to human causes. (Ballotpedia, 2017-02; Climate Central, 2017-01; The Guardian, 2018-12)</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism and Spending Scrutiny:</strong> As a member of the House Committee on Appropriations, Representative Zinke consistently advocates for "fiscal responsibility" and "restoring accountability to federal spending," expressing concerns about "runaway spending and woke government programs." (Ryan Zinke Press Release, 2025-09; YouTube, 2025-07)</li>
<li><strong>Prioritization of Energy Dominance and Resource Development:</strong> During his tenure as Interior Secretary, Representative Zinke prioritized "American energy dominance" and "increasing natural resource development," which could lead to a preference for funding initiatives aligned with these goals over pure scientific research. (U.S. Department of the Interior, 2018-04; U.S. Department of the Interior, 2017-06)</li>
<li><strong>Focus on Local Infrastructure and Law Enforcement:</strong> Representative Zinke's recent Community Project Funding requests for Montana primarily focus on infrastructure improvements, economic development, and law enforcement capabilities, indicating competing priorities for federal investment. (Ryan Zinke Press Release, 2025-05; Ryan Zinke Press Release, 2025-07; Ryan Zinke House.gov, 2025-05)</li>
