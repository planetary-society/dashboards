    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.
    All AI-generated claims, assessments, and recommendations should be independently verified.

<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Ross's membership on the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee positions her as a key voice in NASA's budget and programs, indicating a foundational interest in scientific endeavors. Her district has directly benefited from over $2.8 million in NASA Earth science grants to institutions like North Carolina State University and Fathom Science, Inc. in Raleigh, demonstrating a clear local stake in the Science Mission Directorate. Furthermore, her support for the CHIPS and Science Act and advocacy for science-based policy, including involvement in the recent NASA Reauthorization Act, underscore a consistent commitment to scientific investment.</p>
<p>While no direct challenges to her receptiveness were identified, the severity of the proposed FY2026 budget cuts to NASA Science will necessitate strong advocacy. Given her oversight role, the tangible local benefits, and her record of supporting scientific research, Representative Ross may be receptive to arguments for increased investment in NASA's space science activities, particularly when framed with the direct impact on her constituents and local research institutions.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching the specific impacts of NASA science grants at North Carolina State University and Fathom Science in Raleigh, particularly how their Earth science research (e.g., flood mapping, marine resource management) directly benefits North Carolina communities and aligns with the Representative's focus on scientific data for policy.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's diverse space science missions, including planetary science and astrophysics, contribute to the broader scientific enterprise and national innovation, aligning with the Representative's role on the House Science Committee and her support for the CHIPS and Science Act.</li>
<li>Look into how NASA's Earth science data and research, especially regarding climate and environmental monitoring, directly support evidence-based policymaking relevant to North Carolina's specific challenges, such as coastal resilience and agricultural adaptation, which aligns with her advocacy for science-driven solutions.</li>
</ul>
