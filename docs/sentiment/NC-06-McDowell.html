    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.

<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative McDowell's public emphasis on border security, economic issues, and fiscal conservatism, including calls to cut "wasteful spending," suggests a challenging environment for advocating increased NASA science funding. His lack of space-related committee assignments further limits direct engagement, and the district's modest NASA science contract activity, with the largest contract being for safety shoes rather than direct research, doesn't strongly indicate a direct economic stake in this area. Furthermore, his rhetoric about "woke nonsense" could lead to scrutiny of certain science programs, particularly Earth science.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, there are opportunities for engagement. Representative McDowell has demonstrated support for STEM education and broader federal research, and co-sponsored a bill promoting NASA-DOE science collaboration, including dark matter research. Importantly, institutions within his district have received NASA science grants for diverse research, from microgravity to astrophysics, highlighting tangible local benefits that could be emphasized. His office's active solicitation of FY26 appropriations requests also provides a direct avenue for advocating for these vital science investments.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching the specific NASA science grants received by North Carolina A&amp;T State University, the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, and High Point University, and be prepared to discuss how these local investments align with his support for STEM education and benefit the district.</li>
<li>Explore Representative McDowell's co-sponsorship of H.R.1368, the "DOE and NASA Interagency Research Coordination Act," and consider how to connect NASA science investments to his broader stated support for federal research funding, including medical research.</li>
<li>Look into the process for submitting programmatic and Community Project Funding requests for FY2026, and be prepared to articulate how increased NASA science investment can deliver tangible benefits to NC-06 in a fiscally responsible manner, aligning with his engagement in the appropriations process.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Addison P. McDowell</h2>
<ul>
<li>Graduated from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte in 2016.</li>
<li>Worked in constituent services for Representative Ted Budd.</li>
<li>Served as a lobbyist for Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina.</li>
<li>Worked on a U.S. House of Representatives election campaign.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Support for STEM Education:</strong> Representative McDowell encouraged middle and high school students in North Carolina's 6th congressional district to participate in a STEM app challenge in September 2025, indicating a general appreciation for science and technology education. (South Winston Salem News, 2025-09)</li>
<li><strong>Co-sponsorship of NASA-DOE Research Bill:</strong> Representative McDowell co-sponsored H.R.1368, the "DOE and NASA Interagency Research Coordination Act," introduced in February 2025 and passed by the House in March 2025, which authorizes collaborative research and development between NASA and the Department of Energy, including areas like dark matter. (Congress.gov, 2025-02)</li>
<li><strong>District Benefits from NASA Science Grants:</strong> Institutions within NC-06, including North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, University of North Carolina at Greensboro, and High Point University, have received NASA grants for science activities such as microgravity research, plant biology experiments, and astrophysics observations. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>General Support for Federal Research Funding:</strong> Representative McDowell's office issued a statement in September 2025 acknowledging the importance of investing in medical research for "saving lives and giving families hope," suggesting a broader positive stance on federal funding for scientific innovation. (WXII, 2025-09)</li>
<li><strong>Engagement in Appropriations Process:</strong> Representative McDowell's office is actively soliciting programmatic and Community Project Funding requests for the Fiscal Year 2026 appropriations cycle, providing a mechanism for advocating for federal investments, including potential science initiatives. (Congressman Addison McDowell - House.gov, 2025-04)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competing Priorities Focus:</strong> Representative McDowell's public statements consistently emphasize border security, the fentanyl crisis, and economic issues as top priorities, which may divert legislative attention and resources from increasing investment in NASA science. (McDowell for Congress, 2025; House.gov, 2025; WXII 12 News, 2025-03)</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism and Spending Cuts:</strong> Representative McDowell advocates for "reining in reckless spending" and "cutting wasteful spending," and supports rescission packages, indicating a general inclination towards reducing federal expenditures that could impact NASA's budget. (Heritage Action For America, 2025-06; Congressman Addison McDowell, 2025-02; Addison McDowell touts GOP spending cuts, 2025-07)</li>
<li><strong>No Space-Related Committee Assignment:</strong> Representative McDowell does not hold any current space-related committee assignments in the 119th Congress, which may limit his direct engagement or dedicated advocacy for NASA science initiatives. (Authoritative Committee Data)</li>
<li><strong>Potential for Earth Science Funding Scrutiny:</strong> While not explicitly stated, Representative McDowell's general "America First" and "cutting wasteful spending" rhetoric, including targeting programs perceived as "woke nonsense," could lead to scrutiny or opposition for Earth science funding within NASA. (Addison McDowell touts GOP spending cuts, 2025-07; Heritage Action For America, 2025-06)</li>
