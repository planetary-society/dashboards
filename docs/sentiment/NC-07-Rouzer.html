<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Rouzer's consistent advocacy for reduced federal spending and his skepticism regarding climate science funding present significant hurdles to securing increased investment in NASA's science activities, especially given the proposed 47% budget cut. His legislative priorities often lean towards transportation, agriculture, and economic deregulation, suggesting that broad increases in basic space science funding may not align with his primary objectives.</p>
<p>However, his direct involvement with NASA as a member of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee and co-sponsor of the NASA Reauthorization Act of 2024 indicates a foundational understanding and support for the agency. The presence of multiple NASA science grants in his district, particularly those supporting Earth science research at local universities, provides a tangible connection to the benefits of NASA's scientific endeavors, offering a potential avenue for advocating for specific, locally impactful science initiatives.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider highlighting specific local impacts of NASA science grants, such as the flood mitigation research at UNC Wilmington, and connecting these to Representative Rouzer's interest in coastal community issues and his agricultural background.</li>
<li>Explore Representative Rouzer's specific contributions or questions during recent House Science, Space, and Technology Committee hearings on NASA's budget or the NASA Reauthorization Act to identify his priorities and potential areas of common ground.</li>
<li>Look into how the deep learning research at Fayetteville State University or other local NASA science initiatives contribute to workforce development and technological innovation within the district, aligning with his business background and focus on economic growth.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About David Rouzer</h2>
<ul>
<li>Earned a B.A. in agricultural business management, agricultural economics, and chemistry from NC State.</li>
<li>Served as assistant to the dean at NC State's College of Agriculture and Life Sciences.</li>
<li>Worked as an associate-rural administrator for the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</li>
<li>Owned and operated small businesses, The Rouzer Company and Warehouse Distribution.</li>
<li>Previously served as a legislative aide for U.S. Senators and as a North Carolina State Senator.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Membership on House Science, Space, and Technology Committee:</strong> As a member of this committee, Representative Rouzer is directly involved in legislative oversight and funding decisions for NASA, including its Science Mission Directorate and exploration programs, indicating a direct engagement with these issues. (House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, Current)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support for Local NASA Grants:</strong> Multiple NASA grants, including those for Earth science research and deep learning applications, have been awarded to the University of North Carolina at Wilmington and Fayetteville State University within his district, demonstrating direct local benefit from NASA science funding [cite: USAspending, FY2022-FY2024]. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support for NASA Reauthorization Act of 2024:</strong> Representative Rouzer was a co-sponsor of H.R.8958, the NASA Reauthorization Act of 2024, which passed the House in September 2024 and includes provisions supporting NASA's Earth science research and the Commercial SmallSat Data Acquisition Program. (Congress.gov, 2024-09)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Membership on Environment Subcommittee:</strong> Representative Rouzer is a member of the Environment Subcommittee of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, which has jurisdiction over environmental research, climate change research, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), directly aligning with NASA's Earth science activities. His background in agricultural business management and chemistry from NC State further connects to scientific and environmental interests [cite: biography]. (House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, Current)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Participation in NASA Budget Hearings:</strong> As a member of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, Representative Rouzer has participated in hearings concerning NASA's proposed budgets for fiscal years 2024 and 2025, demonstrating his direct involvement in the agency's funding discussions and oversight. (Congress.gov, 2023-04, 2024-04)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Representative Rouzer consistently advocates for reduced federal spending, a balanced budget, and tax cuts, which could lead to pressure for cuts across discretionary spending, including NASA science.</li>
<li><strong>Skepticism on Climate Science Funding:</strong> Despite local Earth science grants in his district, Representative Rouzer has voted against legislation supporting clean energy infrastructure and has been criticized for a voting record on climate change that critics argue exacerbates storm costs.</li>
<li><strong>Competing Legislative Priorities:</strong> As Chairman of the Subcommittee on Highways and Transit and a member of the Agriculture Committee, Representative Rouzer's public statements and legislative efforts frequently prioritize transportation infrastructure, agriculture, defense, and border security.</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on Economic Deregulation and Tax Relief:</strong> Representative Rouzer consistently advocates for reducing government regulations and lowering taxes to stimulate economic growth and job creation, which may lead to a preference for federal spending with direct, immediate economic returns over basic science.</li>
<li><strong>Potential for Prioritizing Applied over Basic Science:</strong> His focus on coastal community issues like flood mitigation and environmental contaminants, as well as his agricultural background, suggests a potential preference for NASA science activities with clear, near-term applied benefits. [cite: 5, 13, USAspending, FY2022-FY2024]</li>
