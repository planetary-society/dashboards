<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Harris may present significant challenges for advocates seeking increased NASA space science funding, particularly given the proposed 47% budget cut for FY2026. His stated belief in Young Earth creationism could create ideological friction with core NASA science fields like planetary science and astrophysics. Furthermore, the complete absence of NASA Science Mission Directorate contracts or grants in his district removes a direct economic incentive for his support, and his focus on fiscal conservatism may lead to scrutiny of non-defense discretionary spending.</p>
<p>Despite these hurdles, there is a potential opening through his support for STEM education, evidenced by his sponsorship of the Congressional App Challenge. Advocates could highlight how NASA's science missions inspire students, develop a skilled workforce, and drive technological innovation, framing increased investment as foundational for future American competitiveness and STEM pipeline development.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching how NASA's science missions, such as those exploring exoplanets or the universe's origins, directly inspire student participation in STEM activities like the Congressional App Challenge, linking current educational efforts to future scientific careers.</li>
<li>Explore how investments in NASA's science programs, even without direct local contracts, contribute to broader national technological advancements and economic competitiveness that could indirectly benefit his constituents, or identify local academic institutions that could pursue future NASA science grants.</li>
<li>Look into how NASA's science discoveries, particularly those related to engineering marvels or the pursuit of knowledge, can be presented in a way that resonates with broader values of human ingenuity and exploration, potentially finding common ground beyond specific scientific origins.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Mark Harris</h2>
<ul>
<li>Holds a Bachelor's in political science and advanced degrees in theology.</li>
<li>Served as a Baptist pastor and president of the Baptist State Convention of North Carolina.</li>
<li>No public record found of military service or direct industry ties.</li>
<li>Believes in Young Earth creationism, a stance on scientific origins.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Support for STEM Education:</strong> Representative Harris sponsors the Congressional App Challenge for his district, promoting middle and high school student engagement in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math, which is foundational for future space scientists and engineers. (Congressman Mark Harris, 2024)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ideological Conflict with Science:</strong> Representative Harris's stated belief in Young Earth creationism may present an ideological conflict with scientific consensus in fields central to NASA's Science Mission Directorate, such as planetary science and astrophysics. (Biography, N/A)</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Local Economic Ties:</strong> No direct NASA Science Mission Directorate contracts or grants have been identified within Representative Harris's district, indicating a potential absence of local economic incentives for increased NASA science investment. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Absence of Space-Related Committee Influence:</strong> Representative Harris holds no current space-related committee assignments in the 119th Congress, which limits his direct influence and dedicated focus on space policy matters. (Space_committees, N/A)</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism Focus:</strong> Representative Harris has publicly emphasized fiscal responsibility, a common conservative priority that may lead to scrutiny of non-defense discretionary spending, including NASA's science budget. (Fayetteville Observer, 2018-05)</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Public Support for NASA Science:</strong> No public record has been found indicating Representative Harris has made specific statements or taken actions in support of NASA's science activities or space exploration programs. (No public record found)</li>
