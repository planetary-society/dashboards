    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.

<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Harrigan's role on the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, combined with his engineering background, indicates a potential receptiveness to NASA's mission. He has publicly stated that American leadership in science and technology, including space exploration, is "essential to our national security, economy, and future," and has supported interagency science collaboration. Furthermore, his district directly benefits from NASA science grants to Wake Forest University for Earth science and biological research critical to long-duration spaceflight and lunar exploration, providing a strong local connection to these programs.</p>
<p>However, advocates should anticipate a skeptical reception due to his strong fiscal conservative stance and consistent calls to reduce federal spending. While he supports strategic investments, he has also expressed concerns about the efficiency of federal R&amp;D and prioritizes national security and defense spending. Therefore, framing increased NASA science funding as a vital, strategic investment that yields concrete returns for national leadership, economic growth, and local research, rather than as "wasteful spending," will be essential to gain his support, particularly in light of the proposed 47% cut.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider highlighting specific NASA science grants at Wake Forest University and how they contribute to North Carolina's economy, foster innovation, and support national security interests, aligning with his stated priorities for American leadership in science and technology.</li>
<li>Explore how increased investment in NASA's space science activities can be framed as a strategic, catalytic investment, similar to the COTS program he praised, demonstrating a strong return on investment and addressing concerns about federal R&amp;D efficiency.</li>
<li>Look into how NASA's space science initiatives, particularly those with interagency collaboration potential or broader societal benefits, align with his role on the Science Committee and his support for coordinated research efforts.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Pat Harrigan</h2>
<ul>
<li>Graduated from West Point with a Bachelor of Science in nuclear engineering.</li>
<li>Served as an engineer prior to his congressional service.</li>
<li>Former U.S. Army Special Forces officer, with two deployments to Afghanistan.</li>
<li>Awarded two Bronze Star Medals for his military service.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Committee Leadership:</strong> Representative Harrigan serves on the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, which has direct oversight of NASA, and has stated that "American leadership in science and technology isn't optional—it's essential to our national security, economy, and future," and that he will "fight to ensure we invest in real innovation" in areas including space exploration.</li>
<li><strong>Local NASA Science and Exploration Investments:</strong> Wake Forest University, located in his district, has received multiple NASA grants for Earth science research on coastal marshes and climate regulators, as well as biological and physical sciences research related to long-duration spaceflight, astronaut performance, and lunar/Martian exploration. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Support for Interagency Science Collaboration:</strong> Representative Harrigan co-sponsored H.R.1368, the DOE and NASA Interagency Research Coordination Act, which provides statutory authority for collaborative research and development between the two agencies, including in areas like dark matter and data sharing.</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for Space Exploration and Innovation:</strong> His official website highlights his work to "expand investments in cutting-edge industries like advanced manufacturing, space exploration, and research and development" to strengthen the economy and ensure American leadership.</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on Strategic Investment in Space:</strong> During a committee hearing, Representative Harrigan cited the NASA COTS program as a "great example" of a catalytic investment that reasserted U.S. leadership in the commercial space industry, underscoring his view on the importance of strategic government funding.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Representative Harrigan consistently advocates for cutting "wasteful spending" and reducing the national debt, having voted for legislation to cut billions from federal programs.</li>
<li><strong>Strong National Security Focus:</strong> His background as a Green Beret and frequent public statements emphasize increasing defense spending and national security as top priorities, which could potentially compete with non-defense science funding.</li>
<li><strong>Skepticism on Federal R&amp;D Efficiency:</strong> Harrigan has expressed concern regarding the return on investment for long-term federal research, questioning the effectiveness of significant past spending in areas like fusion power.</li>
<li><strong>Prioritization of Specific Energy Initiatives:</strong> He strongly advocates for an "all-of-the-above" energy strategy focused on domestic production, including fossil fuels and nuclear power, for energy independence and national security, which may overshadow other science areas.</li>
<li><strong>Broad Competing Legislative Priorities:</strong> Harrigan consistently highlights border security, economic issues (inflation, taxes), and military strength as his primary legislative focuses, which may limit his attention or advocacy for increased NASA science funding.</li>
