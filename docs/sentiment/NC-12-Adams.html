    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.
    All AI-generated claims, assessments, and recommendations should be independently verified.

<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Adams may be receptive to arguments for increased NASA space science funding, particularly when framed around STEM/STEAM education, workforce development, and the benefits to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs). Her strong advocacy for environmental protection and climate action, coupled with local NASA Earth science grants to the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, indicates a clear alignment with NASA's Earth Science Mission Directorate.</p>
<p>However, advocates should be mindful that space science is not a stated primary focus among her many priorities, and she lacks direct committee assignments to influence NASA's budget. While Earth science resonates, broader advocacy for other science directorates (astrophysics, planetary, heliophysics, biological and physical sciences) may require more tailored arguments to overcome competing interests and her limited public record on these specific areas, especially in light of the proposed significant budget cuts.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching specific examples of how NASA's broader science missions (beyond Earth science) engage and benefit Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority-Serving Institutions, particularly those in North Carolina, to align with her strong advocacy for these institutions and STEM/STEAM education.</li>
<li>Explore how the specific NASA science grants received by the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, such as those in astrobiology or environmental justice, directly contribute to local workforce development, inspire students, or address community needs within her district.</li>
<li>Look into how investments in diverse NASA science disciplines, like planetary science or astrophysics, can inspire K-12 and college students, foster innovation, and contribute to the skilled workforce pipeline in North Carolina, connecting to her STEM PREP Act and education background.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Alma S. Adams</h2>
<ul>
<li>Earned B.S. and M.S. degrees in Art Education from North Carolina A&amp;T State University.</li>
<li>Holds a Ph.D. in Art Education and Multicultural Education from Ohio State University.</li>
<li>Served as a college administrator and art professor at Palmer Institute and Bennett College.</li>
<li>Co-founded the African American Atelier, an organization promoting visual arts.</li>
<li>Prior public service includes Greensboro City School Board and City Council.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Strong Advocate for STEM/STEAM Education:</strong> Representative Adams co-founded and co-chairs the Congressional Bipartisan HBCU Caucus, emphasizing the importance of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in producing STEM/STEAM graduates and advocating for equitable federal resources for these institutions. Her background includes degrees in Art Education and serving as a college professor. (The Washington Informer, 2024-04; House.gov, Education; Biography)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support for Research Funding at Local Institutions:</strong> Representative Adams has highlighted the importance of federal funding for research, including a new $50 million R&amp;D grant program for HBCUs and Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs) in the 2023 federal budget. The University of North Carolina at Charlotte, located in her district, has received NASA grants for science activities, including astrobiology and Earth science research. (House.gov, Full Biography; USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Environmental Science and Climate Change Advocacy:</strong> As a member of the Congressional Safe Climate Caucus, Representative Adams advocates for strong environmental policies and recently urged the EPA to maintain climate change protections, citing North Carolina's vulnerability to severe weather. A NASA grant to UNC Charlotte for environmental justice initiatives using Earth science information aligns with these concerns. (Quiver Quantitative, 2025-09; House.gov, Energy and Environment; USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Demonstrated Bipartisan Collaboration on Science-Related Issues:</strong> Representative Adams co-founded and co-chairs the Congressional Bipartisan HBCU Caucus, and recently co-introduced a bipartisan, bicameral resolution recognizing National Stillbirth Prevention and Awareness Day, emphasizing the need for increased research and funding in under-researched areas. (House.gov, Full Biography; Merkley, Booker, Grassley, Hinson, and Adams, 2025-09)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Focus on Workforce Development in Science Fields:</strong> Representative Adams introduced the STEM PREP Act to create a pipeline of skilled workers in STEM fields, indicating a broader interest in developing the scientific and technical workforce. Her past support for National Science Foundation funding for workforce development programs at UNC Charlotte further illustrates this commitment. (House.gov, Education; Congresswoman Alma Adams, 2015-07)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competing Priorities Focus:</strong> Representative Adams' public statements and official platforms consistently emphasize a wide range of social, economic, and educational priorities, including healthcare, education, hunger, poverty, and environmental protection, with no explicit mention of NASA or space science as a primary focus. (Alma Adams, US Congress, North Carolina's 12th District, 2025-09; Congresswoman Alma Adams - House.gov, 2025-09; State Government, 2025-04)</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Direct Space-Related Committee Influence:</strong> Representative Adams holds no current space-related committee assignments in the 119th Congress, limiting her direct legislative leverage over NASA's budget and policy. (Authoritative Committee Data)</li>
<li><strong>Limited Public Advocacy for Broader Space Science:</strong> While she advocates for environmental protection and climate action, which aligns with NASA Earth Science, her public record does not show specific advocacy for other NASA Science Mission Directorate activities (astrophysics, planetary science, heliophysics, biological and physical sciences) or exploration programs. (Alma Adams, US Congress, North Carolina's 12th District, 2025-09; Congresswoman Alma Adams - House.gov, 2025-09)</li>
