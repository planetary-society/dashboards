    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.

<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Knott's strong emphasis on fiscal conservatism and "reining in reckless spending" presents a significant challenge for advocating increased NASA space science funding, particularly in light of the proposed 47% budget cut for FY26. His lack of direct committee assignments related to space and the absence of any NASA science contracts or grants within his district mean there is no immediate local economic incentive or direct policy leverage for him to champion this cause. His stated priorities also lean towards other issues like crime and border security, suggesting NASA science may not be a top legislative focus.</p>
<p>However, there are potential avenues for engagement. Representative Knott has supported designating space as critical infrastructure and promotes STEM education through initiatives like the Congressional App Challenge. Arguments connecting NASA science investment to long-term economic growth, technological innovation, and national strategic interests could align with his stated priorities. His office's assistance with federal grants also indicates a general openness to securing federal resources for his constituents if a compelling case is made for the broader benefits of NASA science.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching how NASA science investments contribute to critical infrastructure resilience and generate economic growth through technological spin-offs and workforce development, aligning with his co-sponsorship of the Space Infrastructure Act and focus on North Carolina's economy.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA science initiatives, even without direct local contracts, foster STEM talent and innovation that could benefit North Carolina's future workforce, connecting to his promotion of the Congressional App Challenge and interest in federal grants.</li>
<li>Look into personal stories from constituents in NC-13 who have been inspired by or benefited from NASA science, framing these investments as critical for U.S. leadership and national security, which may resonate with his background and focus on national interests.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Brad Knott</h2>
<ul>
<li>Earned a bachelor's degree from Baylor University.</li>

</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Support for Space as Critical Infrastructure:</strong> Representative Knott co-sponsored H.R.1154, the Space Infrastructure Act, which designates space systems, services, and technology as a critical infrastructure sector, indicating recognition of space's strategic importance. (Congress.gov, 2025-02)</li>
<li><strong>Promotion of STEM Talent:</strong> His office promotes the Congressional App Challenge, an initiative encouraging high school students in his district to develop skills in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. (Congressman Brad Knott, House.gov, 2025-04)</li>
<li><strong>Facilitation of Federal Grants:</strong> Representative Knott's office provides resources and assistance for constituents seeking federal grants, demonstrating a mechanism for supporting local entities in accessing federal funding opportunities, which could include NASA programs. (Congressman Brad Knott, House.gov, 2024-05)</li>
<li><strong>Focus on Economic Growth:</strong> A stated priority for Representative Knott is "building an environment for continued economic growth in North Carolina's 13th District and across the nation," which could align with arguments for NASA science investment as a driver of innovation and economic benefit. (Congressman Brad Knott, House.gov, 2025-01)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>No Space-Related Committee Role:</strong> Representative Knott does not hold any committee assignments related to space in the 119th Congress, limiting his direct influence on space policy and funding. (Authoritative Committee Data)</li>
<li><strong>Focus on Competing Priorities:</strong> His stated legislative priorities and public statements emphasize combating crime, securing the border, and fostering economic growth, with no explicit mention of NASA or science activities. (Congressman Brad Knott, House.gov, 2025-09; WUNC, 2025-09)</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Representative Knott has consistently advocated for "reining in reckless spending" and "cutting government" in his public statements regarding budget resolutions and tax policy. (Congressman Brad Knott, House.gov, 2025-02; North Raleigh Today, 2025-04)</li>
<li><strong>Absence of Local NASA Economic Ties:</strong> There are no public records of significant NASA Science Mission Directorate contracts or grants within North Carolina's 13th Congressional District, reducing a potential local economic incentive for support. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Explicit Space Advocacy:</strong> No public record found of specific statements or legislative actions by Representative Knott advocating for increased investment in NASA's space science activities or exploration programs.</li>
