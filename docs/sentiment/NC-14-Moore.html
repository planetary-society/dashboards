    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.

<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Moore's consistent fiscal conservatism and emphasis on federal spending cuts, alongside his primary legislative focus on border security and economic issues, suggest he may be initially skeptical of calls for increased NASA space science funding. His lack of a direct committee assignment related to space also means he is not positioned as a natural champion for NASA's Science Mission Directorate within the legislative process.</p>
<p>However, there are specific opportunities for engagement. His district benefits from NASA Earth Science contracts, notably with Satellogic Federal, LLC, and a constituent contributes to planetary science software. Furthermore, his legislative actions regarding supersonic air travel and local weather radar infrastructure demonstrate an interest in scientific data and NASA's role in applied technology, providing concrete examples to connect broader space science investments to local and national benefits.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching the specific local economic impact of the NASA science contracts awarded to Satellogic Federal in Davidson and Jerry L. Horsewood in Columbus, preparing to highlight how these investments support jobs and innovation within his district.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's Earth science data, including that acquired through programs like CSDA, directly informs weather forecasting, disaster preparedness, and resource management, aligning with his legislative work on weather radar and FEMA board appointment.</li>
<li>Look into how NASA's broader science investments contribute to national economic competitiveness, technological advancement, and the development of a skilled workforce, framing increased funding as a strategic investment rather than just an expenditure.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Tim Moore</h2>
<ul>
<li>Graduated from the University of North Carolina (1992) and Oklahoma City University School of Law (1995).</li>
<li>Practiced law, opening his own firm in Kings Mountain in 2009.</li>
<li>Co-owns 67 Motors, a metal recycling business in Forsyth County.</li>
<li>Served as Speaker of the North Carolina House of Representatives for ten years.</li>
<li>Appointed to a board investigating FEMA's disaster response following Hurricane Helene.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local Earth Science Data Acquisition:</strong> Representative Moore's district includes Satellogic Federal, LLC in Davidson, NC, which received NASA contracts for the Commercial Smallsat Data Acquisition (CSDA) program, directly supporting NASA's Earth Science Division. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Local Planetary Science Software Development:</strong> A constituent in Columbus, NC, Jerry L. Horsewood, received a NASA contract for maintenance of "Mane software," a tool critical for mission analysis and optimization in NASA's planetary science and exploration programs. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024; Space Flight Solutions, 2021)</li>
<li><strong>Engagement with NASA Aeronautics:</strong> Representative Moore introduced H.R. 4012, the National Airport Supersonic Readiness Act, on June 25, 2025, which directs the FAA and NASA to assess airport readiness for future supersonic and hypersonic commercial air travel, indicating an interest in NASA's aeronautics research and development. (Representative Tim Moore, House.gov, 2025-06-25)</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for Science-Related Infrastructure:</strong> Representative Moore's legislation to address a Charlotte-area weather radar gap passed the House Science Committee on September 15, 2025, demonstrating a focus on scientific data and infrastructure that aligns with Earth science applications. (Representative Tim Moore, House.gov, 2025-09-15)</li>
<li><strong>Support for Federal Appropriations:</strong> Representative Moore voted "Yea" on H.R.5371, the Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2026, on September 19, 2025, which provides funding for federal agencies, including NASA, and ensures continuity of government operations. (Representative Tim Moore, House.gov, 2025-09-19)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Representative Moore has consistently voted for budget resolutions aimed at significant federal spending cuts and has publicly advocated for "spending within our means" and "no new taxes," which could lead to skepticism regarding increased NASA science appropriations.</li>
<li><strong>Competing Priorities:</strong> His stated top legislative priorities include border security, economic improvement, and energy independence, suggesting a focus on domestic and economic issues that may divert attention and resources from growing NASA's space science activities.</li>
<li><strong>Absence of Space-Specific Committee Role:</strong> Representative Moore holds no current space-related committee assignments, which may limit his direct engagement and advocacy for NASA's Science Mission Directorate activities within the legislative process.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Explicit Support for Broad NASA Science:</strong> While he has engaged with NASA on specific issues like supersonic air travel and weather radar, the public record does not show extensive or explicit statements of support for the broader range of NASA's science mission directorates (astrophysics, planetary science, heliophysics, Earth science, and biological and physical sciences).</li>
