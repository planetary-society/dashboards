<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, Senate Committee on Appropriations</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Senator John Hoeven's consistent advocacy for reducing federal discretionary spending and his strong focus on national security space present significant challenges to securing increased funding for NASA's Science Mission Directorate. While he supports North Dakota's involvement in advanced space missions, his public record shows less explicit advocacy for broader science disciplines like astrophysics or planetary science, often prioritizing defense-related space activities. His emphasis on energy development and carbon capture within Earth science may also narrow his focus within that domain.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, his position on the Senate Appropriations Committee offers a direct avenue for influence. Furthermore, his demonstrated support for the NASA Space Grant program and the significant NASA science grants awarded to the University of North Dakota—totaling $1.6 million over the last three years for Earth science (winter storms, arctic change, aerosols) and biological/physical sciences (microbial risks)—provide concrete local examples of the benefits of NASA science investment. Framing increased science funding through these local economic and research ties, and highlighting the direct relevance of these specific science areas to North Dakota, could be a more effective approach.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider highlighting how the specific NASA science grants at the University of North Dakota directly support North Dakota's workforce development and economic diversification, aligning with his past priorities as Governor.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's broader Earth science research, beyond carbon capture, provides critical data for infrastructure resilience, resource management, and national security, connecting to his emphasis on these areas.</li>
<li>Look into specific examples of how NASA science investments yield significant returns in technological innovation and economic benefits, providing data points for his role on the Appropriations Committee.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About John Hoeven</h2>
<ul>
<li>Graduated from Dartmouth College (B.A. 1979) and Northwestern University (MBA 1981).</li>
<li>Served as a banker, including President/CEO of the Bank of North Dakota (1993-2000).</li>
<li>Governor of North Dakota (2000-2010), focusing on economic diversification and energy development.</li>
<li>As Governor, directed development of a multi-resource energy program for North Dakota.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Appropriations Committee Membership:</strong> Senator Hoeven's position as a Member of the Senate Committee on Appropriations provides a direct avenue to influence funding levels for NASA's Science Mission Directorate and exploration programs. (Congress.gov, 2024-03)</li>
<li><strong>Support for Space Grant Program:</strong> He has demonstrated longstanding support for the NASA Space Grant program, which provides fellowships and scholarships for STEM education and space research, including internships at NASA research centers. (Senator John Hoeven, 2025-03)</li>
<li><strong>Local NASA Science Grants:</strong> The University of North Dakota has received multiple NASA grants supporting various science activities, including Earth science research on winter storms and arctic change, and biological and physical sciences research on microbial risks in closed habitats. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for High-Tech Space Missions:</strong> Senator Hoeven has actively promoted North Dakota's involvement in advanced space missions, such as the Space Development Agency's low-Earth orbit satellite network, highlighting the state's role in space research and technology. (Senator John Hoeven, 2025-03)</li>
<li><strong>NASA Collaboration in UAS Research:</strong> He has noted NASA's participation in local unmanned aerial systems (UAS) research initiatives, including Project ULTRA, which connects North Dakota's innovation with broader space-related technological development. (Senator John Hoeven, 2025-07)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism and Spending Reduction:</strong> Senator Hoeven consistently advocates for reducing federal discretionary spending and controlling the national debt and deficit, which could lead to scrutiny of NASA's budget, including science activities. (Hoeven, 2024-08; Hoeven, 2025-05; Hoeven, 2025-07; Hoeven, 2025-03)</li>
<li><strong>Prioritization of National Security Space:</strong> Senator Hoeven frequently emphasizes North Dakota's role in national security space, including missile warning, space domain awareness, and low-Earth orbit satellite missions for military communications, potentially prioritizing defense-related space activities over purely scientific endeavors. (Hoeven, 2025-03; Hoeven, 2025-06; Hoeven, 2023-03; Hoeven, 2022-05; Hoeven, 2020-09)</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on Energy Development and Carbon Capture in Earth Science:</strong> Senator Hoeven's public statements regarding environmental research often highlight carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technologies and the continued use of fossil fuels, which may lead to a narrower focus within NASA's Earth science funding. (Hoeven, 2024-08; Hoeven, 2025-05; Hoeven, 2025-09; Hoeven, 2023-05; Hoeven, 2021-04; Hoeven, 2018-02)</li>
<li><strong>Limited Explicit Advocacy for Broader Space Science Disciplines:</strong> Senator Hoeven's public record primarily highlights defense-related space activities and energy-focused Earth science, with less frequent explicit advocacy for other NASA Science Mission Directorate disciplines such as astrophysics, planetary science, or heliophysics. (Hoeven, 2025-03; Hoeven, 2020-09; Hoeven, 2024-08)</li>
<li><strong>Strong Focus on Local Economic and Workforce Development Ties:</strong> Senator Hoeven consistently links federal investments, including in space-related technology and STEM education, to boosting economic growth and workforce development within North Dakota, exemplified by NASA grants to the University of North Dakota for Earth science and biological/physical sciences. (Hoeven, 2025-08; Hoeven, 2025-03; Hoeven, 2024-08; NDSU, 2024-03; USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
