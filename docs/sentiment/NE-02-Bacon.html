<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Republican Co-Chair, Planetary Science Caucus</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Bacon's leadership as Republican Co-Chair of the Congressional Planetary Science Caucus and his strong opposition to proposed 50% cuts to NASA's Science Mission Directorate in FY26, including specific projects like Mars Sample Return, indicate a clear understanding and advocacy for NASA science. He has actively pushed for "full and robust funding" and warned against the national security and economic risks of underfunding, aligning with his national security background. Furthermore, his district benefits from a significant NASA Earth science grant, providing a local connection to the agency's scientific endeavors.</p>
<p>However, his consistent emphasis on fiscal responsibility and national defense priorities, while sometimes aligning with space investment, could lead him to prioritize defense-related space over substantial increases for pure science missions. While he has demonstrated support for protecting NASA's overall budget, the limited direct economic ties within his district to the broader range of NASA science activities beyond the specific Earth science grant might temper his enthusiasm for across-the-board increases. Advocates should therefore emphasize the national security and economic competitiveness arguments he has already articulated, alongside the specific benefits of planetary and Earth science.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching specific planetary science missions or discoveries that align with his stated concerns about U.S. leadership and the caucus's goals, preparing to reinforce his existing advocacy for robust funding.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's diverse science portfolio, including Earth science applications like the University of Nebraska's drought research, directly contributes to national security, economic competitiveness, and public health outcomes within his district.</li>
<li>Look into examples of how sustained investment in NASA science yields long-term economic returns, technological advancements, and workforce development, framing it as a strategic imperative for U.S. leadership rather than a discretionary expense.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Don Bacon</h2>
<ul>
<li>Served 29 years in the U.S. Air Force, retiring as a Brigadier General.</li>
<li>Specialized in electronic warfare, intelligence, reconnaissance, and was a Master Navigator.</li>
<li>Commanded Air Force wings at Ramstein, Germany, and Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska.</li>
<li>Served as the Air Force's Director of ISR Strategy, Plans, Doctrine and Force Development.</li>
<li>Advocated for elevating space as an official domain of warfare.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Planetary Science Caucus Leadership:</strong> As Republican Co-Chair of the bipartisan Congressional Planetary Science Caucus, he holds a leadership position directly focused on a key NASA Science Mission Directorate discipline.</li>
<li><strong>Opposition to Proposed NASA Science Cuts:</strong> He co-authored a joint statement in April 2025 expressing "extreme alarm" over proposed 50% cuts to NASA's Science Mission Directorate, including Mars Sample Return and the Roman Space Telescope, advocating for "full and robust funding" for Fiscal Year 2026 appropriations.</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for NASA Funding Protection in CR:</strong> In September 2025, he co-led a bipartisan letter urging House Appropriations Committee leaders to include explicit language in an upcoming Continuing Resolution to protect NASA funding at current levels, warning against "irreversible impacts" on U.S. space leadership from proposed cuts.</li>
<li><strong>Local NASA Earth Science Investment:</strong> His district benefits from a $1.0 million NASA grant to the University of Nebraska for identifying public health applications of satellite-derived drought indicators, directly supporting NASA's Earth science activities. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>National Security and Economic Competitiveness Rationale:</strong> He consistently argues that cuts to NASA science would "demolish our space economy and workforce, threaten our national security and defense capabilities, and ultimately surrender the United States' leadership in space" to adversaries.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competing Priorities (Defense Focus):</strong> Representative Bacon's extensive military background and public statements consistently emphasize national security and defense, including space as a domain of warfare, which may lead to prioritizing defense-related space investments over increasing funding for NASA's pure science missions. (Don Bacon Official Website, 2024-03)</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Representative Bacon frequently advocates for fiscal responsibility and reducing government spending, which could make him less inclined to support significant increases in discretionary spending for NASA science activities. (House.gov, 2023-2024)</li>
<li><strong>Limited Direct Economic Ties to Broader NASA Science:</strong> Beyond a specific Earth science grant, the provided contracts indicate limited direct economic ties within NE-02 to NASA's broader Science Mission Directorate activities (astrophysics, heliophysics, biological and physical sciences) and exploration programs, potentially reducing a strong local economic incentive for increased investment across all SMD areas. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
