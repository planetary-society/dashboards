<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, Senate Committee on Appropriations</li>
<li>Member, Senate Committee on Appropriations: Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee</li>
<li>Member, Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Senator Fischer's fiscal conservatism and commitment to scrutinizing federal spending, coupled with her focus on national security space and highly applied research, suggest she may be cautious about increasing NASA's overall science budget, particularly in light of proposed cuts. While she has been recognized as a "Champion of Science," her legislative priorities often lean towards defense-related space or science with direct, tangible local economic or agricultural benefits. This could make advocating for broad increases across all NASA Science Mission Directorate activities, especially those without clear Nebraska ties, challenging.</p>
<p>However, her influential positions on the Senate Appropriations Committee (including the CJS Subcommittee) and the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee provide direct avenues for her to champion NASA. Nebraska institutions, notably the University of Nebraska, receive significant NASA grants for Earth science and planetary protection, and a major systems engineering contract supports NASA missions. Highlighting these local investments and the broader economic and scientific returns of NASA's science portfolio, particularly how it connects to Nebraska's research strengths, could make her more receptive to targeted support for science activities.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider highlighting how increased NASA science investment directly supports the University of Nebraska's research on drought, agriculture, and planetary protection, aligning with her "Champion of Science" recognition and her background in education.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's broader science missions contribute to national security and economic competitiveness by fostering innovation and maintaining U.S. leadership in space, consistent with her work on the Secure Space Act and commitment to strengthening the economy through science.</li>
<li>Look into specific examples of how NASA's overall investments, including contracts with Nebraska companies like McCallie Associates and Li-Cor, demonstrate a strong return on taxpayer investment through local job creation and technological advancement, aligning with her focus on fiscal stewardship.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Deb Fischer</h2>
<ul>
<li>Holds a B.S. degree in education from the University of Nebraskaâ€“Lincoln.</li>
<li>Served on the Valentine Rural High School Board of Education.</li>
<li>Appointed to Nebraska Coordinating Commission for Post-Secondary Education.</li>
<li>Chaired Nebraska Legislature's Transportation and Telecommunications Committee.</li>
<li>Father was Nebraska State Engineer/Director of Department of Roads.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Appropriations Committee Influence:</strong> As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and its Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee, Senator Fischer directly participates in decisions regarding NASA's budget. This role allows her to advocate for federal funding that benefits Nebraska institutions and companies receiving NASA contracts and grants. (Senate.gov, 2025-01-30)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee Role:</strong> Senator Fischer's membership on the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee provides direct oversight and legislative authority over NASA's policy and authorization. This position enables her to shape policies that can support Nebraska's growing space-related industries and research. (Senate.gov, 2024-12-20)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Local NASA Research and Development Investment:</strong> Nebraska institutions, notably the Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska, have received significant NASA grants for Earth science research (e.g., satellite-derived drought indicators) and planetary protection/biological sciences relevant to exploration. Additionally, McCallie Associates, Inc. in Bellevue, NE, holds a substantial NASA contract for mission systems engineering and payload services. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Champion of Science Recognition:</strong> Senator Fischer was recognized as a "Champion of Science" in September 2025 for her consistent support of federally funded scientific research, including agricultural innovation, and has stated her commitment to championing solutions that strengthen the economy and national security through science. This award was based on a nomination from the University of Nebraska, highlighting her advocacy for research at local institutions. (The Science Coalition, 2025-09-02)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bipartisan Space and Technology Legislation:</strong> Senator Fischer co-led the bipartisan Secure Space Act of 2025 to protect U.S. satellite systems from foreign adversaries, demonstrating her engagement with critical space infrastructure and national security aspects of space. Her previous bipartisan work on the Advancing IoT for Precision Agriculture Act of 2021, endorsed by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, further illustrates her support for science and technology R&amp;D with local relevance. (Senator Fischer Press Release, 2025-06-05)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Focus on National Security Space:</strong> Senator Fischer's recent legislative efforts, such as co-leading the Secure Space Act of 2025, and her advocacy for defense appropriations, emphasize space primarily through a national security lens, potentially prioritizing military space applications over pure science or exploration in budget considerations. (Press, 2025-06)</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism and Spending Scrutiny:</strong> Senator Fischer has expressed a commitment to "good stewardship of taxpayer dollars" and "constructive reorganization of our federal agencies," and supported a 2025 budget resolution that directed committees to identify cuts and reforms, indicating a general fiscal conservatism that could lead to scrutiny of NASA science budgets. (YouTube, 2025-02)</li>
<li><strong>Prioritization of Nebraska-specific Research:</strong> Senator Fischer has actively championed and secured significant federal funding for agricultural, bioeconomy, biomedical, and water quality research at Nebraska institutions, including for drought mitigation, highlighting a strong focus on local, applied research that may overshadow broader NASA science disciplines. (Press, 2025-07)</li>
