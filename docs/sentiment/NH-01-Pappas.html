    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.
    All AI-generated claims, assessments, and recommendations should be independently verified.

<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, Planetary Science Caucus</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Pappas's district benefits significantly from NASA science investments, with the University System of New Hampshire receiving substantial contracts for projects in planetary science, heliophysics, Earth science, and astrophysics, directly supporting local jobs and research. His membership in the bipartisan Planetary Science Caucus further indicates a specific interest in this area, and his public support for FIRST Robotics, a major recipient of NASA STEM grants in his district, highlights an appreciation for NASA's educational impact. These strong local ties and demonstrated interests suggest a foundational receptiveness to NASA's scientific mission.</p>
<p>However, his primary legislative focus on healthcare and cost of living, coupled with a stated commitment to fiscal responsibility and reducing government waste, may lead to scrutiny of requests for increased federal spending, especially given the proposed FY26 budget cuts. While he has a clear understanding of NASA's local impact, his lack of direct influence on the House Appropriations or Science committees means advocates will need to clearly articulate the value of sustained or increased science funding against competing priorities and a general push for fiscal efficiency.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider identifying specific examples of how NASA science investments at institutions like the University of New Hampshire or through programs like FIRST Robotics directly benefit his constituents, such as job creation, student opportunities, or technological advancements, to highlight local economic and educational impact.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA science investments demonstrate fiscal responsibility and generate broader societal returns, such as technological spin-offs that benefit healthcare or economic growth, to align with his focus on fiscal efficiency and improving quality of life for New Hampshire families.</li>
<li>Look into the specific areas of planetary science that the Planetary Science Caucus prioritizes to tailor your message, and consider if there are any local community members or businesses that have a personal connection or story related to space exploration or STEM.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Chris Pappas</h2>
<ul>
<li>Graduated from Harvard College with a B.A. in government (2002).</li>
<li>Co-owner of the family-owned Puritan Backroom restaurant in Manchester, NH.</li>
<li>Served in the New Hampshire House of Representatives from 2002 to 2006.</li>
<li>Served on the New Hampshire Executive Council from 2013 to 2019.</li>
<li>Elected U.S. Representative for New Hampshire's 1st district since 2019.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Planetary Science Caucus Membership:</strong> Representative Pappas's membership in the bipartisan Planetary Science Caucus indicates a direct interest in NASA's planetary science activities. (Congressional Record, 119th Congress)</li>
<li><strong>Support for Local NASA Science Research:</strong> The University System of New Hampshire in his district receives significant NASA contracts and grants for projects spanning planetary science, heliophysics, Earth science, and astrophysics, demonstrating a direct economic and scientific benefit to his constituents; for example, UNH has received contracts for the CRATER instrument for LRO, Helioswarm, GLIMR, IMAP, RENU3, and GRAPE. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for STEM Education:</strong> Representative Pappas has publicly supported FIRST Robotics, an organization in his district that receives substantial NASA grants for STEM outreach, aligning with NASA's broader mission to inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers. For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology (FIRST) in Manchester, NH, has received over $12 million in NASA grants for robotics outreach programs, and Representative Pappas has visited their events and highlighted their importance. (Pappas.house.gov, 2024-03-01; USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competing Priorities Focus (Healthcare, Cost of Living):</strong> Representative Pappas has consistently highlighted healthcare affordability and lowering costs for New Hampshire families as primary legislative concerns, which may compete for attention and resources with calls for increased NASA science investment.</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal Responsibility/Wasteful Spending Focus:</strong> Representative Pappas introduced the "Fighting Budget Waste Act" in the 119th Congress to reduce government spending by addressing fragmented, overlapping, or duplicative federal programs, indicating a focus on fiscal efficiency that could lead to scrutiny of federal agency budgets, including NASA's.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Direct Committee Influence on NASA Appropriations:</strong> While a member of the Planetary Science Caucus, Representative Pappas does not serve on the House Appropriations Committee or the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, which directly oversee NASA's budget and authorization, potentially limiting his direct influence on overall NASA science funding levels.</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on Local Community Project Funding:</strong> Representative Pappas's office actively manages a limited number of Community Project Funding requests (typically 15 per fiscal year), prioritizing local projects for federal appropriations, which could divert his advocacy efforts from broader NASA science initiatives.</li>
