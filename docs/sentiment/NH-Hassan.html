    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.

<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Senator Hassan has a strong record of supporting scientific research and STEM education, particularly where it benefits New Hampshire institutions, which are significant recipients of NASA science funding for projects like CRATER, Helioswarm, and ARCS. Her recognition as a "Champion of Science" and advocacy for the CHIPS and Science Act demonstrate a commitment to federal research investment. Her general opposition to federal research funding cuts suggests she may be receptive to arguments against reductions in NASA's science budget.</p>
<p>However, her lack of direct space-related committee assignments and broad policy focus on other state-specific priorities may limit her dedicated attention to NASA's science mission. Advocates should be prepared to emphasize the direct local economic and academic benefits of NASA science programs to New Hampshire, especially in light of proposed budget cuts, to align with her demonstrated support for local research and innovation.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider gathering specific success stories or personal testimonials from researchers at Dartmouth College or the University of New Hampshire whose NASA science-funded projects have led to local innovation or economic benefits, reinforcing her "Champion of Science" recognition.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's significant investment in FIRST Robotics in Manchester directly supports New Hampshire's K-12 STEM education goals and workforce development, aligning with her advocacy for the CHIPS and Science Act and related legislation.</li>
<li>Look into how NASA science activities, particularly those with local ties, contribute to broader societal benefits like climate monitoring or technological advancements, demonstrating a strong return on investment that aligns with her focus on efficient federal spending.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Margaret Wood Hassan</h2>
<ul>
<li>Earned a B.A. from Brown University and a J.D. from Northeastern University School of Law.</li>
<li>Practiced law, including as associate general counsel for Brigham and Women's Hospital.</li>
<li>Served as a New Hampshire State Senator and later as the 81st Governor of New Hampshire.</li>
<li>As Governor, signed legislation creating a state commission on sea level rise.</li>
<li>No military service or direct space industry ties are noted in her background.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>"Champion of Science" Award:</strong> Senator Hassan was recognized as a "Champion of Science" by The Science Coalition in February 2024 for her support of federally funded scientific research, stating its criticality to the economy and way of life. Dartmouth College, a recipient of NASA contracts for projects like Auroral Reconstruction Cubeswarm (ARCS) and Relativistic Electron Atmospheric Loss (REAL), nominated her for this award. (Dartmouth, 2024-02)</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for CHIPS and Science Act:</strong> Senator Hassan was a strong advocate for the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, which authorized federal funding for science, engineering, and manufacturing workforce training, emphasizing that "investing in scientific research is what helps America stay at the cutting edge of technology." This act benefits New Hampshire institutions like the University System of New Hampshire and Dartmouth College, which receive significant NASA funding for heliophysics and other science activities. (Dartmouth, 2024-02; Senator Maggie Hassan, 2022-05)</li>
<li><strong>Bipartisan STEM Education Legislation:</strong> Senator Hassan co-reintroduced the bipartisan Mathematical and Statistical Modeling Education Act in June 2025 to modernize K-12 STEM education through National Science Foundation grants, highlighting the importance of "high-quality STEM education" for the 21st-century economy. This aligns with NASA's investment in STEM education, including grants to FIRST in Manchester, NH, for robotics programs. (Senator Maggie Hassan, 2025-06; USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Opposition to Federal Research Funding Cuts:</strong> Senator Hassan expressed concern in March 2025 regarding proposed federal research funding cuts, specifically visiting Dartmouth Cancer Center to discuss the impact on scientists and innovation. This indicates a general stance against reductions in federal research investment, which could extend to NASA's science programs, directly impacting local institutions like Dartmouth College. (Valley News, 2025-03)</li>
<li><strong>Support for New Hampshire Research Institutions:</strong> Senator Hassan has consistently welcomed federal grants to New Hampshire's research institutions, including the University of New Hampshire and Dartmouth College, for scientific research. These institutions are major recipients of NASA Science Mission Directorate contracts and grants for projects such as CRATER, Helioswarm, and IMAP, demonstrating her support for local entities engaged in NASA-related science. (Senator Maggie Hassan, 2022-05; USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>No Direct Space-Related Committee Assignments:</strong> Senator Hassan does not hold any current space-related committee assignments in the 119th Congress, which may limit her direct legislative influence or dedicated focus on space policy issues.</li>
<li><strong>Broad Policy Focus with Competing Priorities:</strong> Her public record emphasizes a wide range of state-specific economic, health, and infrastructure issues, including lowering costs for Granite Staters, strengthening supply chains, and addressing the fentanyl crisis, which may naturally divert focus from specific federal agency investments like NASA science.</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on Fiscal Responsibility and Waste Reduction:</strong> Senator Hassan has supported legislation aimed at reducing waste and saving taxpayer dollars, such as reintroducing the "Duplication Scoring Act," indicating a general inclination towards scrutinizing federal spending for efficiency.</li>
