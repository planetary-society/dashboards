<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, Senate Committee on Appropriations</li>
<li>Member, Senate Committee on Appropriations: Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Senator Shaheen, as Chair of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies, possesses significant influence over NASA's budget and has a strong record of securing funding for space science, often exceeding presidential requests. Her consistent advocacy for heliophysics and Earth science, including full funding for New Hampshire-based projects like UNH's GLIMR instrument and HelioSwarm mission, directly benefits her constituents and aligns with increased investment in these areas. The substantial NASA science contracts and grants awarded to the University of New Hampshire, Dartmouth College, and FIRST in Manchester underscore the tangible local economic and research benefits of these programs.</p>
<p>Despite this strong record, Senator Shaheen emphasizes fiscal responsibility and acknowledges budgetary constraints, which may temper enthusiasm for large, across-the-board increases, especially given the proposed 47% cut for FY2026. Advocates should clearly articulate how robust NASA space science funding, particularly in areas like heliophysics and Earth science, provides critical returns on investment for national security, economic growth, and scientific leadership, while also addressing her concerns about program efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Her lack of a direct STEM background means connecting these benefits to broader societal impacts will be crucial.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider preparing specific examples of how NASA science investments, particularly in heliophysics and Earth science, directly translate into jobs, research opportunities, and STEM education successes at New Hampshire institutions like UNH, Dartmouth, and FIRST.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's space science activities, particularly Earth science and heliophysics, provide tangible benefits to New Hampshire and the nation, such as improved weather forecasting, climate monitoring, or protecting critical infrastructure from space weather, aligning with her focus on fiscal responsibility and broader societal impact.</li>
<li>Look into Senator Shaheen's specific legislative actions and public statements as CJS Appropriations Chair regarding NASA's heliophysics and Earth science programs, and be prepared to highlight how increased investment in these areas directly supports her established priorities and New Hampshire's research strengths.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Jeanne Shaheen</h2>
<ul>
<li>Holds a bachelor's degree in English and a master's in political science.</li>
<li>Professional experience includes teaching high school in two states.</li>
<li>Served as Director of Harvard University's Institute of Politics.</li>
<li>No direct professional background in STEM fields or space exploration.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Appropriations Subcommittee Chairmanship:</strong> As Chair of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies, Senator Shaheen directly influences NASA's budget, having helped secure $25.43 billion for NASA in the FY2025 CJS Appropriations bill, an increase above the President's request. This role allows her to champion New Hampshire institutions like the University of New Hampshire and Dartmouth College, which receive significant NASA contracts for space science research.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Advocacy for Heliophysics:</strong> Senator Shaheen has consistently advocated for heliophysics research, expressing concern over proposed cuts and securing increased funding, including $812 million for heliophysics research in the FY2025 CJS bill, which is $25 million above the President's budget request. This directly benefits the University of New Hampshire, a leading heliophysics institution and home to the HelioSwarm mission, which received $39 million in the FY2025 bill.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support for Earth Science:</strong> She has demonstrated support for NASA Earth Science, securing $2.369 billion in the FY2025 CJS Appropriations bill, including full funding for the University of New Hampshire's Geosynchronous Littoral Imaging and Monitoring Radiometer (GLIMR) instrument. This highlights her commitment to climate research and local scientific contributions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Investment in STEM Education:</strong> Senator Shaheen supports STEM engagement, as evidenced by the FY2025 CJS Appropriations Act providing $144 million for STEM Engagement, including programs like the Space Grant Program. This aligns with the significant NASA grant to FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) in Manchester, NH, which aims to inspire young people in STEM fields (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Direct Support for New Hampshire Research:</strong> Senator Shaheen actively champions NASA-funded research at New Hampshire institutions, hosting NASA Administrator Bill Nelson at the University of New Hampshire in June 2023 to highlight its heliophysics program. She has also secured numerous contracts and grants for UNH and Dartmouth College in areas such as cosmic ray telescopes, auroral reconstruction, and gamma-ray burst investigations (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competing Priorities Focus:</strong> Senator Shaheen's public priorities encompass a broad range of issues including national security, economy and jobs, education, health care, and environmental protection, which may compete for federal funding and attention alongside space science.</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on Fiscal Responsibility:</strong> Senator Shaheen consistently highlights the importance of fiscal responsibility and ensuring taxpayer money delivers results, expressing concerns about cost overruns and scheduling delays in programs like Artemis.</li>
<li><strong>Strong Advocacy for Terrestrial Climate Science:</strong> While supporting NASA Earth Science, Senator Shaheen demonstrates a particularly strong and detailed focus on securing funding for NOAA and Department of Energy programs related to climate change, energy efficiency, and environmental resilience.</li>
<li><strong>Budgetary Constraints:</strong> As Chair of the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Shaheen has acknowledged that significant budget increases for agencies like NASA are challenging due to "fiscal responsibility spending caps."</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Direct STEM Professional Background:</strong> Senator Shaheen's biography indicates no direct professional background in STEM fields or space exploration, which may necessitate advocates clearly articulating the broader societal and economic benefits of space science.</li>
