    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.
    All AI-generated claims, assessments, and recommendations should be independently verified.

<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Stansbury's legislative priorities frequently focus on terrestrial issues such as water security, climate change, and tribal sovereignty, and she does not hold a position on the House Science, Space, and Technology or Appropriations Committees, limiting her direct legislative influence over NASA's budget. Her prior experience at the Office of Management and Budget may also incline her towards a cautious approach to federal spending increases, and many of the NASA contracts in her district are for support services rather than direct scientific research.</p>
<p>However, there are significant opportunities for advocacy. The University of New Mexico in her district receives substantial NASA grants for planetary science, lunar research, and exoplanet studies, demonstrating a direct local benefit from the Science Mission Directorate. Her past advocacy for microgravity research, expressed enthusiasm for astrophysics, and a professional background in science and environmental policy suggest a foundational appreciation for scientific endeavors, including NASA's Earth science activities.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching specific NASA science projects at the University of New Mexico, such as lunar sample analysis or exoplanet studies, to demonstrate the direct local impact of increased science investment in her district.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's Earth science missions directly inform and support her legislative priorities on water security and terrestrial climate change, leveraging her background in environmental policy.</li>
<li>Look into how increased NASA science investment can further inspire STEM engagement and contribute to the economic development of New Mexico's emerging space industry, building on her past support for microgravity research.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Melanie A. Stansbury</h2>
<ul>
<li>Bachelor's in human ecology and natural science; Master's in development sociology.</li>
<li>Ecology instructor at New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science.</li>
<li>Policy advisor on Council on Environmental Quality as a White House Fellow.</li>
<li>Consultant at Sandia National Laboratories; program examiner at OMB.</li>
<li>New Mexico state legislator, focused on energy and water resource management.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local NASA Science Investment:</strong> The University of New Mexico in her district receives significant NASA grants for planetary science research, including studies on lunar materials, early solar system formation, and exoplanets, indicating a direct local interest in NASA's science mission. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for Microgravity Research:</strong> Representative Stansbury secured amendments to the America COMPETES Act to direct National Science Foundation grant funding for microgravity research, explicitly stating its importance for New Mexico's growing space industry. (Congresswoman Melanie Stansbury, 2022-02)</li>
<li><strong>Enthusiasm for Astrophysics and Space Exploration:</strong> She highlighted New Mexico's contributions to the James Webb Space Telescope during a House hearing and expressed personal excitement for its discoveries, emphasizing its role in inspiring future generations in STEM fields. (Congresswoman Melanie Stansbury, 2022-11)</li>
<li><strong>Background in Science and Environmental Policy:</strong> Her professional background includes work as a science educator, researcher on natural resource issues, and a policy advisor on the Council on Environmental Quality, suggesting a foundational appreciation for scientific endeavors, including NASA's Earth science activities. (Congresswoman Melanie Stansbury, 2024-05)</li>
<li><strong>Support for Science Infrastructure:</strong> She has requested Community Project Funding to modernize computational infrastructure at the University of New Mexico for cybersecurity and data science, demonstrating support for foundational research capabilities that can benefit various scientific disciplines. (Congresswoman Melanie Stansbury, 2024-05)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competing Legislative Priorities:</strong> Representative Stansbury's public record indicates a strong focus on issues such as water security, terrestrial climate change, tribal sovereignty, and economic development, which may lead to space science not being a primary legislative focus. (Rep. Stansbury Official Website, 2024-09)</li>
<li><strong>Absence from Key Space-Related Committees:</strong> Representative Stansbury does not hold a position on the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology or the House Appropriations Committee, limiting her direct legislative influence over NASA's budget and policy decisions. (space_committees, 2025-09)</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on Terrestrial Environmental Science:</strong> Her background and public statements frequently highlight terrestrial environmental concerns and climate change, potentially leading to a greater emphasis on non-space-based scientific investments. (Santa Fe New Mexican, 2023-10)</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal Prudence from OMB Background:</strong> Her prior experience as a program examiner at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) may incline her towards a cautious approach to federal spending increases, potentially impacting advocacy for significant growth in NASA science budgets. (Biography, 2025-09)</li>
