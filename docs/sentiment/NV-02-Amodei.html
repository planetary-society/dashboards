<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Appropriations</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Amodei's strong fiscal conservative stance and consistent advocacy for reduced federal spending present a significant challenge to securing increased NASA science funding. His legislative actions prioritizing local economic development and public land sales over federal land use, including a direct conflict with a NASA satellite calibration request, suggest a potential reluctance to support federal agency needs that compete with local interests or broader budgetary constraints. Furthermore, his emphasis on national debt reduction and other priorities could lead to pressure for cuts across federal agencies, including NASA's Science Mission Directorate.</p>
<p>However, his membership on the House Appropriations Committee offers a direct avenue for influence, and the substantial NASA Science Mission Directorate contracts and grants within Nevada's 2nd Congressional District, particularly for planetary science and Earth science, provide a compelling local economic and scientific argument. These local investments, coupled with his expressed desire for bipartisan solutions and general interest in federal technology assessment, could make him receptive to advocacy that clearly demonstrates the tangible benefits and economic returns of NASA science programs for his constituents.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider exploring how the specific NASA science contracts and grants in Reno translate into local job creation, economic development, and educational opportunities within his district, providing concrete examples of the return on federal investment.</li>
<li>Explore how increased investment in NASA's science activities can be framed as a fiscally responsible investment that aligns with his stated desire for bipartisan solutions and contributes to national competitiveness and technological leadership.</li>
<li>Look into how the specific science projects funded in Nevada, such as planetary science and Earth science research, contribute to broader technological advancements and position Nevada as a leader in cutting-edge federal research, aligning with his interest in technology assessment.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Mark E. Amodei</h2>
<ul>
<li>Earned a B.A. in Political Science and a J.D. from the University of the Pacific.</li>
<li>Served as an officer in the U.S. Army Judge Advocate General's Corps (1983-1987).</li>
<li>Practiced law for over two decades; also led the Nevada Mining Association.</li>
<li>Previously served in both the Nevada Assembly and Nevada Senate.</li>
<li>Chaired the Nevada Legislature's Education Technology Committee.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key Appropriations Role:</strong> Representative Amodei's membership on the House Committee on Appropriations provides him direct influence over NASA's budget, including its Science Mission Directorate activities.</li>
<li><strong>Significant Local NASA Science Investment:</strong> Nevada's 2nd Congressional District receives substantial NASA Science Mission Directorate contracts and grants for planetary science (DAVINCI+ mission), Earth science, and biological/physical sciences, primarily through Reno-based entities like Situation Awareness Systems LLC and the Nevada System of Higher Education. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Committee Support for Science and Exploration:</strong> As a member of the House Appropriations Committee, Representative Amodei is part of the body that has included language in recent appropriations reports supporting "fundamental scientific research" and "space exploration" at fiscally responsible levels.</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for Bipartisan Solutions:</strong> Representative Amodei has publicly expressed a desire for bipartisan cooperation on the Appropriations Committee, emphasizing moving beyond partisan "talking points" to achieve solutions, which could facilitate consensus on NASA science funding.</li>
<li><strong>Interest in Federal Technology Assessment:</strong> Representative Amodei led an Appropriations Committee hearing where he discussed the importance of technology assessments in areas such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing, indicating a general appreciation for federal investment in advanced research.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Representative Amodei consistently advocates for reduced federal spending and has voted for legislation aimed at limiting government expenditures, which could lead to pressure for cuts across federal agencies, including NASA.</li>
<li><strong>Prioritization of Local Economic Development over Federal Land Use:</strong> He introduced legislation in June 2023 to reverse a Department of the Interior withdrawal of land in Railroad Valley, Nevada, that NASA requested for satellite calibration, citing the importance of mineral development and local control over federal land decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Push for Public Land Sales for Development:</strong> Amodei has introduced amendments and legislation, including in May 2025, to sell or exchange hundreds of thousands of acres of public lands in Nevada for housing and economic development, indicating a preference for these uses over federal land preservation or other federal agency needs.</li>
<li><strong>Broader Competing Budgetary Priorities:</strong> His stated priorities include national debt reduction, border security, and national defense, which could compete with increased investment in NASA science activities for federal funding.</li>
