<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Appropriations</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative LaLota's position on the House Appropriations Committee presents a direct opportunity to influence NASA's Science Mission Directorate budget, and his consistent advocacy for Stony Brook University's NASA grants, totaling over $8 million in recent years, demonstrates a clear appreciation for local science investment. His engagement with NASA contracting for small businesses also suggests a desire to ensure local economic benefits from space activities. However, his strong fiscal conservative stance and support for broad spending cuts, coupled with skepticism on climate science funding, pose significant challenges, particularly for Earth science programs.</p>
<p>While he has publicly supported "strong federal investments in research and education," his focus on reducing the national debt and cutting "bloated agencies" could lead him to view NASA science funding, especially the proposed 47% cut in FY2026, as an area for reduction rather than growth. Advocates should emphasize the direct local economic and research benefits from NASA science contracts and grants in NY-01, particularly those at Stony Brook University and local businesses like Canon U.S.A. and Soliense Inc., to align increased funding with his stated priorities.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching specific success stories or local impacts from the NASA grants at Stony Brook University, particularly those related to planetary science or exploration, to highlight the tangible benefits of these investments in his district.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's science investments directly support local businesses in NY-01, such as Soliense Inc. or Canon U.S.A., by providing contracts that create jobs and foster technological innovation within the district.</li>
<li>Look into how NASA's science programs demonstrate fiscal efficiency and a strong return on investment, perhaps by highlighting how research breakthroughs lead to commercial applications or contribute to national security interests, aligning with his fiscal conservatism and military background.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Appropriations Committee Member:</strong> Representative LaLota's position on the House Committee on Appropriations provides a direct mechanism to influence federal spending, including NASA's Science Mission Directorate budget.</li>
<li><strong>Champion of Local Research Funding:</strong> Representative LaLota has consistently advocated for and announced significant federal research grants for Stony Brook University, including over $9 million in NASA grants for Earth science, planetary science, and exploration, stating that "Stony Brook's world-class research and development projects deserve all the funding they need." (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Public Support for Science Investment:</strong> Representative LaLota publicly advocated on the House floor for "strong federal investments in research and education," highlighting Stony Brook University's role in driving innovation and discovery.</li>
<li><strong>Engagement with NASA Contracting for Small Businesses:</strong> Representative LaLota co-authored a letter to NASA expressing concerns that changes to its contracting system could limit small business participation, indicating engagement with NASA's operational policies and a desire to ensure local businesses, such as Canon U.S.A., Inc. and Soliense Inc. in NY-01, can contribute to federal projects. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Record of Bipartisan Collaboration:</strong> Representative LaLota has emphasized his record of bipartisan legislative success, indicating a potential willingness to collaborate across the aisle on issues like NASA science funding, which often garners broad support.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Representative LaLota has consistently advocated for reducing the national debt and supported budget resolutions calling for broad spending cuts across government agencies. (Congressman Nick LaLota, 2025-03; PolitiFact, 2025-03)</li>
<li><strong>Skepticism on Climate Science Funding:</strong> Despite joining the Climate Solutions Caucus, Representative LaLota voted for the "Lower Energy Costs Act," which aimed to increase fossil fuel production and scale back climate initiatives, indicating potential vulnerability for NASA Earth Science funding. (The East Hampton Star, 2023-08)</li>
<li><strong>Competing Priorities:</strong> Representative LaLota's public statements and campaign focus frequently highlight border security, military support, and local Long Island issues, potentially diverting attention and advocacy from broader NASA science and exploration initiatives. (CBS News, 2024-10; LaLota for Congress)</li>
<li><strong>Opposition to "Bloated Agencies":</strong> Representative LaLota has explicitly supported measures to "drastically cut bloated agencies and lower government operating costs," which could extend to NASA if its programs are not perceived as essential or efficient. (LaLota for Congress)</li>
<li><strong>Appropriations Committee Influence:</strong> As a member of the House Committee on Appropriations, Representative LaLota holds a position with direct influence over federal spending decisions and has demonstrated a willingness to support cuts in other federal programs.
