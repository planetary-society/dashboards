<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Garbarino's lack of direct committee influence over NASA and his voting record favoring federal spending caps, such as the Fiscal Responsibility Act, suggest a challenging environment for advocating for increased NASA science funding, especially given the proposed FY26 cuts. His primary legislative focus on homeland security, financial services, and local infrastructure may also overshadow space science priorities, and his nuanced stance on federal environmental initiatives could lead to skepticism regarding Earth science programs.</p>
<p>However, there are guarded reasons for optimism. His past opposition to NIH cuts and support for the CHIPS Act indicate a general appreciation for federal R&amp;D investment and STEM education, which aligns with NASA's scientific mission. Furthermore, companies in his district, like Raith America and PLX Inc., have received NASA contracts for specialized equipment, providing a direct economic link and potential local interest in the agency's continued activities and technological advancements.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider exploring how the specialized equipment provided by companies in his district, like electron beam lithographers, directly supports NASA's pioneering science missions and how these advanced technologies foster innovation that could benefit local industries and STEM workforce development.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's science missions, including those utilizing equipment from his district, inspire students and contribute to the STEM workforce pipeline, aligning with his support for the Congressional App Challenge and broader interest in R&amp;D.</li>
<li>Look into how strategic investments in NASA's science activities, while mindful of fiscal responsibility, yield long-term returns in innovation, national security, and American competitiveness, aligning with his interest in R&amp;D and securing U.S. leadership.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Andrew R. Garbarino</h2>
<ul>
<li>Earned B.A. in history and classical humanities, J.D. from Hofstra Law.</li>
<li>Worked at family law firm; family owns several small businesses.</li>
<li>Served as New York State Assemblyman from 2013 to 2020.</li>
<li>Requested DNI analysis on Chinese biotechnology and U.S. alternative proteins R&amp;D.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Opposed cuts to federal research funding:</strong> Representative Garbarino joined a bipartisan letter expressing concern over proposed cuts to National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants, indicating a general support for federal science funding. These cuts would impact Long Island research institutions, including Stony Brook University, which stands to lose significant annual funding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Promotes STEM education and innovation:</strong> Representative Garbarino actively participates in and promotes the Congressional App Challenge, a national competition designed to encourage student creativity and participation in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) fields. A student from Eastport South Manor Junior-Senior High School in his district won the 2024 Congressional App Challenge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>District benefits from NASA contracts:</strong> Companies within Representative Garbarino's district have received NASA contracts for specialized equipment, such as electron beam lithographers for nano-sized structures and dynamic climate chambers for exobiology research, demonstrating a direct economic and technological tie to NASA's scientific endeavors. Raith America Inc., Schenck Corp, PLX Inc., and Binder Inc. are located in NY-02. [cite: USAspending, FY2022-FY2024]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Voted for significant federal R&amp;D investment:</strong> Representative Garbarino voted in favor of the CHIPS Act (H.R. 4346), which included substantial funding increases for university research through the National Science Foundation and for research at the Department of Energy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Advocates for innovation and technology:</strong> Representative Garbarino introduced the "Certainty for Our Energy Future Act" to promote innovation in emerging energy sectors and prioritize American innovation, and has engaged in discussions on "secure by design" principles for Artificial Intelligence, indicating a broader interest in technological advancement and R&amp;D.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of Direct Space-Related Committee Influence:</strong> Representative Garbarino holds no current assignments on committees directly overseeing NASA or space policy, limiting his direct legislative platform for advocating for NASA science and exploration. (Authoritative Committee Data)</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism and Spending Caps:</strong> His voting record, including support for the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, indicates a priority for reducing federal spending and imposing discretionary spending caps, which could constrain growth or lead to cuts in non-defense discretionary agencies like NASA. (House.gov, 2023-05-31)</li>
<li><strong>Competing Legislative Priorities:</strong> His primary committee assignments (Homeland Security, Financial Services) and stated legislative focus on border security, cybersecurity, financial markets, and local infrastructure projects suggest these areas may take precedence over advocating for increased NASA science funding. (House.gov, 2025-09-22; House.gov, 2024-03-06; Andrew Garbarino, About Andrew)</li>
<li><strong>Nuanced Stance on Federal Environmental Initiatives:</strong> While a member of climate caucuses, his voting record includes opposition to certain federal environmental funding and regulations, which could translate to skepticism or limited support for NASA's Earth science activities. (League of Conservation Voters, 2024; Andrew Garbarino, Energy &amp; Environment)</li>
<li><strong>Focus on Manufacturing/Economic Development over Pure Science Research in Local Contracts:</strong> The NASA contracts in his district are primarily for manufacturing and equipment supply, rather than direct scientific research grants, which might lead to a focus on the economic impact of NASA rather than the intrinsic value of science missions. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
