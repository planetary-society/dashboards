<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Appropriations</li>
<li>Ranking Member, House Committee on Appropriations: Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Meng's position as Ranking Member on the House Appropriations CJS Subcommittee makes her a crucial voice for NASA's budget. She has explicitly and strongly opposed proposed cuts to NASA's science account in the FY2026 budget, calling them "the largest cuts in American history" and directly urging against them. Her advocacy for STEM education, including arranging a NASA astronaut visit to her district, and local grants for heliophysics and broader science programs at CUNY, suggest a foundational appreciation for scientific endeavors.</p>
<p>However, her role also requires balancing NASA's needs with other agencies under the CJS umbrella, and broader federal budget constraints will always be a factor. While she opposes science cuts, the overall trend in some appropriations proposals has still favored exploration over science, indicating potential internal budgetary tensions. Despite her strong statements, the relatively modest direct NASA science contract and grant funding within her district, outside of specific CUNY research, means that the economic impact of these programs may not be a primary driver for her.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider connecting Representative Meng's strong public opposition to cuts in NASA science funding with the specific science grants received by the Research Foundation of CUNY in her district, illustrating the local academic and research benefits of sustained investment.</li>
<li>Explore how to share personal stories or examples of how NASA science activities, including those supported by local grants, inspire students and contribute to STEM workforce development in her district, building on her past efforts to bring a NASA astronaut to Queens.</li>
<li>Look into how NASA science investments, beyond just research, also support local businesses like Kepco, Inc. in Flushing, demonstrating economic value and job creation that can be highlighted when discussing competing CJS agency priorities and overall budgetary constraints.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Grace Meng</h2>
<ul>
<li>Earned a B.A. from the University of Michigan and a J.D. from Cardozo School of Law.</li>
<li>Practiced law before serving in the New York State Assembly.</li>
<li>Served in the New York State Assembly from 2009 to 2012.</li>
<li>Elected as the first Asian American woman to Congress from New York in 2012.</li>
<li>No direct STEM or space-related professional background is publicly recorded.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ranking Member on Key Appropriations Subcommittee:</strong> Representative Meng's role as Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (CJS) directly positions her to influence NASA's budget, including science activities.</li>
<li><strong>Strong Opposition to NASA Science Budget Cuts:</strong> Representative Meng has explicitly opposed proposed cuts to NASA's science account and scientific research in the FY2026 budget, describing them as "the largest cuts in American history" and stating, "Do not cut scientific research" to NASA's Acting Administrator.</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for STEM Education:</strong> She has advocated for increased funding for NASA's Office of STEM Engagement and expressed concern over cuts to STEM education programs, emphasizing their importance for inspiring future generations. A local connection is her arrangement for a NASA astronaut to speak with students in Queens, her district, to inspire interest in space and STEM.</li>
<li><strong>Support for Broad NASA Science Programs:</strong> Institutions in her district, such as the Research Foundation of the City University of New York, have received NASA grants for diverse science activities, including heliophysics and broader science programs encompassing planetary and Earth science. [cite: USAspending, FY2022-FY2024]</li>
<li><strong>Bipartisan Alignment on Rejecting Extreme Cuts:</strong> The Planetary Society commended Representative Meng, alongside the House CJS Chair, for rejecting extreme cuts to NASA and NASA science in the FY2026 CJS legislation, indicating potential for bipartisan collaboration on this issue.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competing CJS Agency Priorities:</strong> As Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee, Representative Meng must balance funding for NASA science with the needs of other agencies under the subcommittee's jurisdiction, such as the Departments of Commerce and Justice, and the National Science Foundation.</li>
<li><strong>Overall Federal Budgetary Constraints:</strong> Despite her stated opposition to cuts, broader federal spending caps and the need for bipartisan compromise in appropriations bills can limit the extent to which NASA science funding can grow.</li>
<li><strong>Potential Prioritization of Exploration over Science:</strong> While Representative Meng opposed cuts to NASA science, the FY2026 House CJS bill she opposed still showed a trend of trimming science funding while boosting money for space exploration, indicating potential internal budgetary tensions within NASA's portfolio.</li>
