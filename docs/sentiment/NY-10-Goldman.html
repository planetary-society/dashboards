    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.

<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Daniel S. Goldman's lack of a direct committee assignment overseeing NASA and his primary legislative focus on non-space issues suggest that advocating for increased NASA space science funding may not be an immediate priority for his office. While he has supported federal research funding generally and specifically for renewable energy, his public record does not extensively feature broad advocacy for NASA's diverse science portfolio beyond climate-related areas.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, significant local ties offer strong advocacy potential. His district directly benefits from substantial NASA Science Mission Directorate grants to New York University for astrophysics and Earth science research, alongside contracts with Odyssey Space, LLC for mission development. These local impacts, combined with his demonstrated support for "cutting-edge research" and federal funding for science, provide a compelling basis to discuss how a proposed 47% cut to NASA's science budget would directly threaten local academic institutions, jobs, and U.S. scientific leadership in critical areas like Earth science and astrophysics.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider highlighting how NASA's Earth science research, particularly on climate and environmental monitoring, directly supports the Representative's demonstrated interest in renewable energy and climate science, drawing a clear connection between space science and his legislative priorities.</li>
<li>Explore connecting NASA's broader science mission to the Representative's support for federal research funding and STEM education by showcasing how local institutions like NYU benefit from NASA grants, fostering innovation and a skilled workforce in his district.</li>
<li>Look into how the work of local companies like Odyssey Space, LLC, which received a NASA contract for mission design, exemplifies how investments in NASA science translate into local economic development and high-tech job creation within the district.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Daniel S. Goldman</h2>
<ul>
<li>Graduated from Yale University (B.A. in history) and Stanford Law School (J.D.).</li>
<li>Served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York.</li>
<li>Was lead counsel for the House impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump.</li>
<li>Investments include defense contractors Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Support for Federal Research Funding:</strong> Representative Goldman led a bipartisan letter urging the National Institutes of Health to reverse grant cuts, emphasizing the importance of federal funding for "lifesaving medical research" and "cutting-edge research" to maintain U.S. scientific leadership. This action directly impacts New York, which is a leading recipient of NIH funding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Advocacy for Renewable Energy Research:</strong> Representative Goldman introduced an amendment to the FY26 Energy and Water Appropriations bill to reallocate $93 million from fossil fuel research to renewable energy research, demonstrating a commitment to increasing investment in scientific areas related to climate and environmental science. This aligns with broader goals for New York's clean energy transition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Local NASA Astrophysics and Earth Science Grants:</strong> New York University, located in Representative Goldman's district, received significant NASA Science Mission Directorate grants totaling over $2.7 million for astrophysics and Earth science research, indicating a direct local academic and research interest in NASA's scientific portfolio. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Local Space Industry Engagement:</strong> Odyssey Space, LLC, a company within Representative Goldman's district, was awarded a NASA contract for the development and delivery of mission design and instrument systems, directly supporting space science missions and fostering local industry involvement in the space sector. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>General Support for STEM Education:</strong> Representative Goldman has been associated with discussions on "STEM in Action" and advocates for increased federal funding for education, including higher education, which is foundational for developing the scientific and engineering workforce necessary for NASA's missions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>No direct space committee assignment:</strong> Representative Goldman does not serve on any committees directly overseeing NASA or space policy, which may limit his direct engagement and influence on these issues. (Congress.gov, 2025-09; House.gov, 2025-09)</li>
<li><strong>Strong focus on non-space legislative priorities:</strong> Representative Goldman's public record and legislative efforts primarily emphasize social equity, public welfare, criminal justice reform, healthcare, immigration, and local economic development, which may divert attention from dedicated space policy advocacy. (PoliScore, 2025-09; House.gov, 2025-09)</li>
<li><strong>Specific focus on climate and renewable energy science:</strong> While supportive of environmental science, Representative Goldman's explicit legislative actions regarding science funding have focused on reallocating Department of Energy funds towards renewable energy, potentially indicating a narrower prioritization within the broader science portfolio. (Quiver Quantitative, 2025-09; House.gov, 2025-09)</li>
<li><strong>Lack of explicit public advocacy for broad NASA science:</strong> Despite local district ties to NASA grants for various science activities, Representative Goldman's public statements and legislative record do not extensively feature explicit advocacy for the full scope of NASA's Science Mission Directorate activities or exploration programs. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024; House.gov, 2023-2025)</li>
