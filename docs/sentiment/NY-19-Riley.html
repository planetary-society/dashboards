    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.
    All AI-generated claims, assessments, and recommendations should be independently verified.

<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Riley's membership on the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology provides a direct and significant opportunity for engagement on NASA's budget. His district also benefits substantially from NASA science investments, including Cornell University's $2.0M contract for the Caesar comet mission and over $4.3M in Earth science grants, demonstrating tangible local impact from planetary and Earth science programs. Furthermore, his co-sponsorship of bipartisan legislation supporting energy efficiency and agricultural research indicates a general appreciation for scientific research and development.</p>
<p>However, Representative Riley's primary legislative focus appears to be on rural economic development, agricultural support, energy affordability, and healthcare access. While his committee role and the district's NASA contracts offer a strong foundation, advocates should be prepared to clearly articulate how increased NASA science funding, particularly in Earth science or biological and physical sciences, directly aligns with and benefits these core constituent priorities to secure his robust support.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider identifying specific researchers or students at Cornell University involved in the NASA-funded planetary or Earth science projects to share personal stories of local impact and scientific discovery.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's Earth science data and research, particularly on climate, water resources, or remote sensing, can directly support Representative Riley's legislative goals for agricultural resilience or energy efficiency in rural communities.</li>
<li>Look into how NASA science investments, including smaller contracts with companies like Grammatech or Triple Cities Metal Finishing, contribute to local job creation and economic diversification within the 19th district.</li>
</ul>
