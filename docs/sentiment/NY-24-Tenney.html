    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.
    All AI-generated claims, assessments, and recommendations should be independently verified.

<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Tenney's position on the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee offers a direct avenue for discussing NASA's science mission, indicating a foundational engagement with space policy. Her district also benefits from NASA science, with a notable planetary science grant for Mars InSight research at SUNY Geneseo and contracts for precision optics, demonstrating local economic and academic ties to space exploration. Her past support for interagency science collaboration and nuanced opposition to NASA legislation, focused on efficiency rather than mission, suggest a potential openness to specific, well-justified science investments.</p>
<p>However, advocates should be prepared for her strong fiscal conservatism and skepticism towards broad federal spending, which could make increasing NASA's overall science budget challenging, especially in light of the proposed 47% cut for FY2026. Her past opposition to climate science initiatives also poses a risk for Earth science funding. To be effective, advocates should emphasize the direct local benefits, national security implications, and non-climate-related aspects of NASA's science portfolio, framing investments as efficient and critical for U.S. competitiveness rather than broad spending.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching specific individuals or departments at the Research Foundation for the State University of New York in Geneseo or Optipro Systems, LLC in Ontario, to share personal stories about how NASA science investments directly create local jobs and foster innovation within NY-24.</li>
<li>Explore how increased, targeted investment in NASA's space science can align with Representative Tenney's stated priorities for U.S. economic competitiveness and national security, leveraging her position on the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee.</li>
<li>Look into examples of how NASA's science programs demonstrate efficiency and accountability, potentially addressing her concerns about federal spending and politicization, while highlighting the unique scientific contributions of projects like the Mars InSight mission.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Claudia Tenney</h2>
<ul>
<li>Received a B.A. from Colgate University and a J.D. from University of Cincinnati.</li>
<li>Practiced law privately and as a partner in a Utica-area firm.</li>
<li>Co-owned Mid-York Press, a family-started commercial printing company.</li>
<li>Served as legal counsel and Chief of Staff for a New York Assemblyman.</li>
<li>Co-hosted local radio and television programs for several years.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>House Science, Space, and Technology Committee Membership:</strong> Representative Tenney serves on the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, which has jurisdiction over non-defense federal scientific research and development, including NASA, indicating direct engagement with space policy and science oversight. (Congresswoman Tenney Press Release, 2023-02)</li>
<li><strong>Local Planetary Science Research:</strong> The Research Foundation for the State University of New York in Geneseo, NY (within NY-24) received a $220K NASA grant for research related to the Mars InSight mission, directly supporting planetary science activities. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Local Optics and Photonics Industry:</strong> Optipro Systems, LLC in Ontario, NY (within NY-24) received a $149.5K NASA contract in September 2025 for SBIR polishing iridium coatings and has a history of NASA Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) awards for precision optics fabrication. (HigherGov, 2025-09)</li>
<li><strong>Support for Interagency Science Collaboration:</strong> Representative Tenney co-sponsored and voted "Yes" on H.R. 1368, the DOE and NASA Interagency Research Coordination Act, which provides statutory authority for collaborative research and development between the two agencies, including areas like dark matter. (Congress.gov, 2025-03)</li>
<li><strong>Focus on NASA Efficiency and Non-Politicization:</strong> While voting "No" on the FY2025 NASA Reauthorization Act (H.R. 8958), her stated reasons were to push for reforms in commercial space permitting and to prevent politicization of the agency, rather than opposing NASA's mission or science funding. (House.gov, 2025-09)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Representative Tenney consistently advocates for reduced federal spending and has voted against large government funding bills, indicating potential resistance to increased NASA science budgets. (Finger Lakes Daily News, 2024-03)</li>
<li><strong>Opposition to Climate Science Funding:</strong> She has expressed opposition to legislation promoting a "radical climate-change agenda" and "Green New Deal policies," which may lead to scrutiny of NASA Earth science activities related to climate research. (The Freedom Index, 2021-06; House.gov, 2023-02)</li>
<li><strong>Prioritization of National Security/Economic Competitiveness:</strong> While supporting scientific innovation for national security, her concerns about federal funding benefiting foreign adversaries suggest a preference for NASA investments with clear, direct ties to U.S. economic or security advantages. (House.gov, 2022-07; House.gov, 2023-02)</li>
<li><strong>Skepticism of Broad Science Funding:</strong> Her vote against the National Science Foundation bill (H.R. 2225) in 2021, which authorized significant federal science funding, indicates a potential general skepticism towards large-scale science initiatives. (The Freedom Index, 2021-06)</li>
