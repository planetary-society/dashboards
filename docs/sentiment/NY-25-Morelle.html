<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Appropriations</li>
<li>Member, House Committee on Appropriations: Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Morelle's position on the House Appropriations Committee and its Commerce, Justice, Science (CJS) Subcommittee makes him a critical voice for NASA's budget, including science activities. He has explicitly criticized proposed cuts to NASA's Science Mission Directorate, stating in September 2025 that a "$1.3 billion cut" would "delay key scientific missions" and "jeopardize critical efforts in climate monitoring planetary defense and the development of cutting edge technologies." This direct opposition to science cuts, coupled with his district's substantial NASA contracts and grants to L3Harris Technologies and Rochester Institute of Technology for optical systems, astrophysics, and Earth science, indicates a strong alignment with advocacy for increased investment.</p>
<p>While the proposed 47% budget cut for NASA science in FY2026 presents a significant challenge, Representative Morelle's consistent support for science and innovation, along with his district's direct economic ties to NASA, suggests he will be highly receptive to advocacy. His past actions and statements position him as a potential champion for protecting and increasing funding for NASA's space science programs.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching specific individuals or local businesses in NY-25 whose jobs or opportunities are directly supported by the NASA science contracts and grants listed, to personalize the economic impact of these investments.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA science grants to Rochester Institute of Technology contribute to workforce development, STEM education, and technological innovation within his district, aligning with his past focus on higher education and manufacturing.</li>
<li>Look into preparing to thank Representative Morelle for his explicit past opposition to proposed cuts to NASA's science mission directorate, reinforcing how such cuts would directly impact the critical research and economic activity in his district.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Joseph D. Morelle</h2>
<ul>
<li>Received a bachelor's degree in political science from SUNY Geneseo.</li>
<li>Served as New York State Assembly Majority Leader, authoring over 200 laws.</li>
<li>Chaired Assembly Tourism Committee; served on Economic Development and Higher Education committees.</li>
<li>Authored a 2005 report on "Creating a State of Innovation" for New York's economy.</li>
<li>Requested creation of the Assembly Subcommittee on Manufacturing, supporting industrial development.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key Appropriations Role:</strong> As a member of the House Committee on Appropriations and its Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (CJS) Subcommittee, Representative Morelle holds a direct position to influence NASA's budget, including science activities. This role directly impacts the funding for local institutions like L3Harris Technologies and Rochester Institute of Technology, which receive significant NASA contracts and grants.</li>
<li><strong>Explicit Support for NASA Funding:</strong> In July 2025, Representative Morelle stated, "Today, as the Trump administration attempts to gut scientific research programs, we must recommit to funding the discoveries of our future," reflecting a clear stance against cuts to scientific research, including NASA. This general support aligns with the scientific research conducted at Rochester Institute of Technology, which receives NASA grants for astrophysics and Earth science.</li>
<li><strong>Active Opposition to Science Cuts:</strong> During a September 2025 markup of the CJS funding bill, Representative Morelle criticized a proposed "$1.3 billion cut to NASA's science mission directorate," arguing it would "delay key scientific missions" and "jeopardize critical efforts in climate monitoring planetary defense and the development of cutting edge technologies." This directly protects funding for science areas relevant to his district's institutions.</li>
<li><strong>District's Economic Ties to NASA:</strong> His district benefits from substantial NASA contracts with L3Harris Technologies for optical telescope assembly and advanced mirror technology, and grants to Rochester Institute of Technology for astrophysics, Earth science, and detector development, creating a strong local economic and research interest in NASA's continued investment. L3Harris Technologies and Rochester Institute of Technology are located in Rochester, NY, within his district. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Consistent Support for Science and Innovation:</strong> Representative Morelle has a public record of supporting federal funding for science and higher education in his district, including announcing NSF grants for Rochester Institute of Technology for cybersecurity and semiconductor lab upgrades, demonstrating a broader commitment to scientific advancement. Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) is a key recipient of these funds, directly benefiting his constituents.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li>No salient risk indicators identified in the public record.</li>
