    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.
    All AI-generated claims, assessments, and recommendations should be independently verified.

<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Miller's membership on the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, where he chairs the Environment Subcommittee, indicates a direct legislative interest in NASA's scientific endeavors, including Earth science. He is a strong advocate for NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) and has actively worked to grow its footprint in Northeast Ohio, which directly supports NASA's science and exploration missions. His district benefits from significant NASA science contracts and grants, including those for microgravity research, planetary science related to Venus, and critical space communications technology that enables scientific data transfer.</p>
<p>While his record demonstrates clear support for NASA's presence and technological development in his district, advocates should emphasize how increased investment in NASA's Science Mission Directorate directly benefits GRC's capabilities and the local aerospace industry. Highlighting the specific science work conducted by companies like Zin Technologies and the Ohio Aerospace Institute, which receive substantial NASA science funding, can underscore the tangible economic and scientific contributions to his constituents. Framing the proposed 47% budget cut as a threat to these local investments and the foundational research that GRC supports could be particularly effective.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching recent successes or specific projects at Zin Technologies or the Ohio Aerospace Institute that are directly supported by NASA science funding, and be prepared to share how these investments create jobs or foster innovation in his district.</li>
<li>Explore how increased investment in NASA's space science activities could directly support the technologies or research areas Representative Miller has publicly championed, such as fission surface power or advancements at NASA Glenn Research Center.</li>
<li>Look into how enhanced NASA science funding could further strengthen initiatives like the NASA Talent Exchange Program Act, fostering greater collaboration between NASA, local universities, and aerospace companies in Ohio.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>House Science Committee Member:</strong> Representative Miller's membership on the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, and his role as chairman of the Environment Subcommittee, indicates a direct legislative interest in NASA's scientific activities, including Earth science. (Max Miller Official Website, 2025)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Champion of NASA Glenn Research Center:</strong> He has consistently expressed strong commitment to supporting NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) and growing its footprint in Northeast Ohio, a key center for aeronautics, space communications, and microgravity research, which directly supports NASA's science and exploration missions. Local companies like Zin Technologies and Ohio Aerospace Institute in his district receive significant NASA contracts related to these areas. (Max Miller Official Website, 2025), (WKYC, 2025), (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Advocate for NASA HQ in Ohio:</strong> Representative Miller has actively led bipartisan efforts, including a letter with 11 representatives and both Ohio senators, to relocate NASA Headquarters to Ohio, emphasizing the state's aerospace heritage, cost savings, and leveraging assets like GRC to enhance NASA's overall mission. (Max Miller Official Website, 2025), (WKYC, 2025), (AIP.ORG, 2025)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Co-sponsor of NASA Talent Exchange Program Act:</strong> In December 2023, he co-introduced the bipartisan NASA Talent Exchange Program Act, aiming to foster innovation and collaboration between NASA and the aerospace industry through personnel exchanges, which can benefit scientific and exploration endeavors. This legislation could directly benefit companies and research institutions in his district that partner with NASA. (U.S. Congress, 2023)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Engagement on NASA Science and Technology Funding:</strong> During a May 2024 House Science, Space &amp; Technology Committee hearing, Representative Miller questioned NASA Administrator Bill Nelson on funding for fission surface power and resources for NASA Glenn's communication services, demonstrating interest in critical technologies that underpin future space science and exploration. (Forbes, 2024)</p>
