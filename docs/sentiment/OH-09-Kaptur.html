<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Appropriations</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Kaptur's district has significant ties to NASA's science mission, including a recently celebrated $282.1 million contract for Sierra Lobo Inc. that she explicitly linked to advancing science and anchoring spaceflight research. Her consistent advocacy for NASA facilities like Glenn Research Center, coupled with her public statements that NASA "unlocks the mysteries of science," suggests a foundational appreciation for space science. Furthermore, the University of Toledo in her district receives substantial NASA grants for Earth science, astrophysics, and planetary science, which she has applauded as vital for scientific leadership.</p>
<p>However, as a member of the House Appropriations Committee, Representative Kaptur balances many competing domestic priorities like jobs, healthcare, and infrastructure. While she supports science and technology, her advocacy is sometimes framed through a national security lens, which could influence specific funding allocations. Despite operating in an environment of federal spending scrutiny, the direct local economic and scientific benefits from NASA contracts and grants provide a strong incentive for her to be receptive to protecting and investing in NASA's space science activities.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider highlighting specific local economic and job impacts from NASA science contracts and grants within her district, such as the Sierra Lobo award and University of Toledo research, to connect investment directly to her constituents' well-being.</li>
<li>Explore how increased NASA science investment contributes to national competitiveness and technological leadership, framing it within the context of U.S. global standing and national security, which aligns with her stated priorities.</li>
<li>Look into how NASA's Earth science or climate research can inform urban planning, infrastructure resilience, or domestic policy challenges, drawing a connection to her background in urban affairs and planning.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Marcy Kaptur</h2>
<ul>
<li>Received a Master of Urban Planning from the University of Michigan.</li>
<li>Began doctoral studies in urban planning development finance at MIT.</li>
<li>Worked as an urban planner and domestic policy advisor on urban affairs.</li>
<li>Engaged in patent reform debates, supporting inventor rights and innovation.</li>
<li>Voted against federally funded embryonic stem-cell research in 2007.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local NASA Contract Advocacy:</strong> Representative Kaptur recently announced and celebrated a $282.1 million NASA award to Sierra Lobo Inc. in her district, explicitly stating its importance for advancing science and anchoring spaceflight research in Northern Ohio. This directly supports NASA's operational and development activities, which are crucial for science missions. (Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur, 2024-02)</li>
<li><strong>Appropriations Committee Influence:</strong> As a Member of the House Committee on Appropriations, Representative Kaptur holds a direct position to influence NASA's budget, including allocations for science activities, and has recently emphasized the need for new resources in science and technology for national competitiveness. (Forbes, 2025-07)</li>
<li><strong>Support for Local University Science Research:</strong> Kaptur has applauded federal research awards to the University of Toledo, stressing the importance of federal funding for scientific leadership and innovation, which includes significant NASA grants for Earth science, astrophysics, and planetary science within her district. (Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur, 2025-07), (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Bipartisan Space Enterprise Advocacy:</strong> She joined a bipartisan Ohio delegation letter in March 2025 advocating for the relocation of NASA Headquarters to Northern Ohio, highlighting the state's suitability for both aeronautics functions and space exploration. (Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur, 2025-03)</li>
<li><strong>Consistent NASA Facility and Science Mission Support:</strong> Representative Kaptur has consistently advocated for NASA's Glenn Research Center and Neil Armstrong Test Facility, participating in tours in August 2023 and affirming that NASA "unlocks the mysteries of science to make the future better for all of us." (The Blade, 2023-08)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competing Domestic Priorities:</strong> Representative Kaptur's public priorities consistently emphasize domestic issues such as jobs, the economy, healthcare, and local infrastructure, which may compete for her focus and advocacy on the House Appropriations Committee.</li>
<li><strong>National Security-Oriented S&amp;T Advocacy:</strong> While advocating for science and technology investment, Representative Kaptur has framed this support within the context of national security and global competition, particularly with China, which may influence her prioritization of specific science activities.</li>
<li><strong>General Federal Spending Scrutiny:</strong> As a member of the House Appropriations Committee, Representative Kaptur operates within a legislative environment that includes discussions about scaling back federal spending, which could create pressure on all discretionary budgets, including NASA science.</li>
