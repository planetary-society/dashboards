<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Senator Husted's strong advocacy for relocating NASA Headquarters to Ohio and his general support for the state's aerospace industry indicate a foundational interest in NASA's presence and economic contributions. However, his consistent emphasis on fiscal responsibility and a lack of specific public statements on individual science mission directorates suggest he may scrutinize proposals for increased NASA science funding, prioritizing local economic impact over broader scientific endeavors.</p>
<p>Despite this, Ohio currently benefits from over $211 million in NASA Science contracts and grants over the last three fiscal years, supporting universities and businesses in areas like Earth science, planetary science, and advanced communication technologies. His co-sponsorship of R&amp;D legislation and promotion of STEM education align with the foundational work of NASA science. Advocates can leverage these existing investments and his focus on innovation to demonstrate how robust science funding directly supports Ohio's economy, research institutions, and talent pipeline, making a case against the proposed FY2026 cuts.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching specific local impacts of the listed NASA science contracts and grants in Ohio, such as job creation or technological advancements, to demonstrate how these investments align with Senator Husted's focus on economic growth and the state's aerospace industry.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's science missions serve as a foundational driver for the kind of research and development, technological innovation, and STEM talent pipeline that Senator Husted has consistently championed through initiatives like InnovateOhio and the American Innovation and Jobs Act.</li>
<li>Look into specific examples of how NASA science investments yield significant returns, such as commercial spin-offs or advancements that improve efficiency, to frame increased funding as a strategic investment rather than just an expenditure, aligning with his emphasis on fiscal responsibility and technology for economic growth.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Jon Husted</h2>
<ul>
<li>Received Bachelor's and Master's degrees from the University of Dayton.</li>
<li>Served as Ohio Secretary of State, leveraging technology for business services.</li>
<li>As Lieutenant Governor, he led InnovateOhio, focusing on technology and innovation.</li>
<li>Held leadership roles in the Ohio House, including Speaker, and served in the Ohio Senate.</li>
<li>Appointed to the board of directors for Heartland Bank in March 2022.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advocacy for NASA Headquarters in Ohio:</strong> Senator Jon Husted has recently led bipartisan efforts to advocate for relocating NASA's headquarters to Cleveland, Ohio, citing the state's aerospace heritage and existing NASA Glenn Research Center, which indicates a strong interest in bolstering NASA's presence and resources within the state.</li>
<li><strong>Support for Research and Development (R&amp;D):</strong> Senator Husted co-sponsored the American Innovation and Jobs Act in May 2025, a bipartisan bill aimed at expanding and strengthening R&amp;D by small businesses and startups, which aligns with fostering the foundational research critical to NASA's science missions.</li>
<li><strong>Promotion of STEM Education and Innovation:</strong> As Lieutenant Governor, Husted championed initiatives like the Ohio Innovation Hubs Program, which allocated state funding to develop innovation hubs focused on digital transformation technologies and increasing STEM graduate retention, directly supporting the talent pipeline for space science and exploration.</li>
<li><strong>Commitment to Ohio's Aerospace Industry:</strong> Senator Husted has actively supported the growth of Ohio's aerospace sector, including the announcement of Joby Aviation's electric air taxi manufacturing facility in Dayton in September 2023 and Boeing's continued investment in Heath in May 2025, demonstrating a broader commitment to the space-related industrial base.</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on Technology and Innovation for Economic Growth:</strong> Through his leadership of InnovateOhio, Husted consistently focused on leveraging technology and innovation to drive economic prosperity and improve services, a posture that suggests openness to investments in advanced scientific and technological endeavors like those undertaken by NASA.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Senator Husted's public statements consistently advocate for fiscal responsibility, tax cuts, and reducing federal spending, which could lead to scrutiny of proposals for increased NASA science funding.</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on Local Economic Impact:</strong> Senator Husted's primary public engagement with NASA has focused on advocating for the relocation of NASA Headquarters to Ohio, emphasizing local economic benefits and cost savings, rather than broad support for NASA's diverse science mission directorates.</li>
<li><strong>Broad Legislative Priorities:</strong> His legislative record and public statements as a Senator indicate a wide range of priorities, including Great Lakes issues, career technical education, and artificial intelligence, which may compete for his attention and advocacy efforts for NASA's science programs.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Public Record on Specific Science Disciplines:</strong> No public record details Senator Husted's specific views or level of support for individual NASA Science Mission Directorate activities such as astrophysics, planetary science, heliophysics, Earth science, or biological and physical sciences.</li>
