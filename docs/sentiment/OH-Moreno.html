<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Senator Moreno's position on the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, coupled with his public statements supporting NASA's importance for national security and Ohio, suggests a baseline receptiveness to space investment. His active advocacy for NASA's presence in Ohio and the substantial $211.1 million in NASA science-related contracts and grants flowing to Ohio universities and businesses, including for exoplanet research and Earth science, provide a strong local economic and scientific foundation for his support.</p>
<p>However, his fiscal conservatism and emphasis on commercialization, efficiency, and national security may lead him to scrutinize pure science programs, particularly if they are perceived as lacking immediate economic or strategic returns. Advocates should therefore frame increased NASA science funding not just as scientific discovery, but as a critical investment in Ohio's economy, American leadership against global competitors, and the development of technologies that benefit both commercial space and national security.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching specific examples of how NASA science investments, particularly the listed contracts and grants in Ohio, directly support local job creation, technological innovation, and economic growth within the state, to connect with his business background and advocacy for Ohio.</li>
<li>Explore how specific NASA science missions and discoveries contribute to long-term U.S. technological leadership, national security, and maintaining a competitive edge in space, aligning with his stated concerns about U.S. dominance.</li>
<li>Look into examples of how NASA's space science programs demonstrate cost-effectiveness, foster public-private partnerships, or lead to innovations that have broader commercial applications, addressing his emphasis on efficiency and private sector integration.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Bernie Moreno</h2>
<ul>
<li>Graduated from the University of Michigan with a business administration degree.</li>
<li>Career in automotive sales, owning multiple car dealerships in Ohio.</li>
<li>Founded Ownum, a blockchain-based technology company.</li>
<li>Extensive ties to the automotive and blockchain/crypto industries.</li>
<li>No military service or direct space/science professional background mentioned.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Direct Support for Increased NASA Funding:</strong> Senator Moreno has publicly stated that NASA is important for national security and Cleveland, predicting a "big increase in funding" for the agency.</li>
<li><strong>Active Role in Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee:</strong> As a member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, and its Subcommittee on Science, Manufacturing, and Competitiveness, Senator Moreno holds a key position to influence NASA's budget and policy, including its science programs.</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for NASA Headquarters Relocation to Ohio:</strong> Senator Moreno co-signed letters and participated in events in March and April 2025 advocating for NASA Headquarters to move to Ohio, citing the state's aerospace heritage and the capabilities of NASA Glenn Research Center.</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on U.S. Space Dominance and Competition:</strong> Senator Moreno has expressed concern about the U.S. position in the space race with China, emphasizing the need to fund NASA to ensure American leadership in moon exploration.</li>
<li><strong>Significant NASA Investment in Ohio's Research and Industry:</strong> Ohio-based universities and companies receive substantial NASA grants and contracts for science and technology development, including projects in Earth science, exoplanet research, planetary science, and advanced space communications. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Senator Moreno has supported legislation like the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which includes tax breaks, and has advocated for taxpayer equity in government-funded corporate projects, indicating a fiscally conservative approach that may lead to scrutiny of NASA's budget, particularly for science programs perceived as lacking immediate economic or national security returns. (WKYC, 2025-08; YouTube, 2025-08)</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on Commercialization and Efficiency:</strong> Moreno has stressed the importance of integrating the private sector into space activities and ensuring NASA programs are cost-effective and efficient, aiming to avoid delays and cost overruns. This focus could lead to a preference for commercially viable space activities over fundamental science missions if they are not perceived as delivering immediate, tangible returns or face significant cost/schedule challenges. (YouTube, 2025-09; YouTube, 2025-04)</li>
<li><strong>National Security and Geopolitical Competition Focus:</strong> His public statements frequently frame space exploration and NASA's role in terms of national security and competition with China, particularly concerning lunar resources and dominance. This emphasis, while supportive of space, might prioritize strategic exploration and defense-related space activities over pure science missions if budget constraints or competing priorities arise. (YouTube, 2025-09; YouTube, 2025-08)</li>
<li><strong>Competing Priorities from Business Background:</strong> Senator Moreno's background is primarily in automotive sales and blockchain technology, with a stated focus on business, tax reform, and deregulation. This orientation towards economic growth and private sector solutions could mean that pure space science activities, especially those without clear and immediate economic or national security benefits, might compete for his attention and support against other priorities.
