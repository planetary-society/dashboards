<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Chair, House Committee on Appropriations</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Cole, as Chair of the House Appropriations Committee, is a critical voice in federal spending decisions, including NASA's budget. While he has expressed concern that proposed budget cuts could have "crippling effects" on the space program and his committee has rejected some White House-proposed reductions to NASA, his committee's own FY2026 Commerce, Justice, Science bill proposes an 18% cut to the Science Mission Directorate. This indicates that while he may generally support NASA, fiscal conservatism and competing priorities could lead to specific reductions in science funding.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, there are clear opportunities for advocacy. His district benefits significantly from NASA Earth science, including a substantial $173.7 million contract to the University of Oklahoma for the GEOCARB mission, which monitors greenhouse gases and vegetation. Highlighting these direct local economic and scientific contributions, alongside his stated appreciation for public investment in research and scientific institutions, could be effective in demonstrating the tangible value of NASA's science portfolio, even amidst broader budget constraints.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider highlighting specific local economic benefits and job creation stemming from NASA science investments in Oklahoma, such as the GEOCARB mission at the University of Oklahoma and the robotics program, to demonstrate the tangible returns on federal investment in his district.</li>
<li>Explore connecting NASA's science mission to America's historical leadership in scientific discovery and technological innovation, appealing to his background in history and his appreciation for institutions like the Smithsonian, to frame space science as a vital component of national prestige and long-term strategic advantage.</li>
<li>Look into framing increased investment in NASA's space science as a fiscally responsible, strategic investment that drives innovation, supports critical research, and maintains U.S. competitiveness, aligning with his stated concerns about "crippling effects" of cuts and the importance of targeted public investment.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Tom Cole</h2>
<ul>
<li>Holds a BA in history, MA from Yale, and PhD from the University of Oklahoma in British history.</li>
<li>Served as an assistant professor of history and politics before entering public service.</li>
<li>Previously served as Oklahoma Secretary of State and in the Oklahoma State Senate.</li>
<li>Worked as a political consultant and for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.</li>
<li>Serves on the Smithsonian Institution Board of Regents, overseeing cultural and scientific institutions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Support for Local NASA Earth Science:</strong> Representative Cole's district benefits from significant NASA investment in Earth science, including a $173.7 million contract to the University of Oklahoma for the GEOCARB mission, which focuses on monitoring greenhouse gases and vegetation health. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Leadership in Rejecting Proposed NASA Cuts:</strong> As Chair of the House Committee on Appropriations, Representative Cole is central to congressional efforts that have advanced full-year funding bills rejecting the White House's proposed cuts to NASA, including significant reductions to space science activities. (Astronomy Magazine, 2025-09; Letter to House Appropriations Committee, 2025-09)</li>
<li><strong>Concern over "Crippling Effects" of NASA Budget Reductions:</strong> Representative Cole has expressed concern that proposed budget cuts from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) could have "crippling effects" on the space program, potentially impacting America's leadership in space and vital research. (News 9, 2025-06)</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for Public Investment in Research:</strong> Representative Cole has highlighted the importance of public investment in research, noting its role in driving advancements and supporting institutions like the University of Oklahoma, which also receives NASA grants for robotics and atmospheric research. (News 9, 2025-06; USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Engagement with Scientific and Cultural Institutions:</strong> His service on the Smithsonian Institution Board of Regents indicates an appreciation for institutions that advance science and culture, aligning with NASA's broader mission of scientific discovery. (House.gov, 2025-09)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Representative Cole, as Chair of the House Committee on Appropriations, consistently advocates for fiscal responsibility and reevaluating federal spending to target investments, which could lead to overall budget constraints impacting NASA's science budget.</li>
<li><strong>Competing National Security Priorities:</strong> Representative Cole frequently frames NASA investments within the context of countering China and maintaining American leadership, suggesting that science activities not directly aligned with national security or geopolitical competition may face lower prioritization.</li>
<li><strong>Skepticism Towards Climate-Related Earth Science:</strong> Despite significant NASA Earth science contracts in his district, the House Appropriations Committee, under Cole's leadership, has supported measures to reduce funding for climate-related efforts and reject climate change executive orders in other agencies.</li>
<li><strong>Proposed Cuts to NASA Science Mission Directorate:</strong> The House Appropriations Committee's FY2026 Commerce, Justice, Science bill, overseen by Chairman Cole, proposes an 18% cut to NASA's Science Mission Directorate, reducing it from $7.3 billion to $6 billion.</li>
