    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.

<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Appropriations</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Bice's position on the House Appropriations Committee provides a direct avenue for influencing NASA's budget, and she has explicitly linked robust NASA science funding to national security and technological leadership. Her district also benefits from direct NASA Science Mission Directorate grants in Earth and biological sciences. However, her vote for the FY2024 CJS Appropriations Act, which included NASA budget reductions, along with her general fiscal conservatism, indicates a potential challenge to increasing science investments.</p>
<p>While a large NASA contract exists in her district, its direct relevance to science mission funding is less clear than the smaller grants. Advocates should emphasize the direct local economic and research benefits of specific science programs, connecting them to her stated support for biotechnology and research. Highlighting how the proposed 47% science budget cut would directly impact these local investments and national strategic goals could be a compelling approach.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching how specific NASA science missions or research areas directly contribute to national security interests or technological leadership, aligning with her explicit statements and role on the National Security Commission on Emerging Biotechnology.</li>
<li>Explore the specific work being done by Lumenus Scientific LLC and Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, and prepare to share how these local NASA science grants translate into jobs, research breakthroughs, or educational opportunities within her district.</li>
<li>Look into how NASA's biological and physical sciences research, particularly in areas like biotechnology, aligns with the goals of the National Biotechnology Initiative Act of 2025 and offers a strong return on federal investment, addressing her fiscal responsibility stance.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Stephanie I. Bice</h2>
<ul>
<li>Graduated from Oklahoma State University with a degree in marketing and international business.</li>
<li>Worked eight years in financial oversight and marketing for a family technology company.</li>
<li>Served as Vice President of Business Development for a digital marketing agency.</li>
<li>Appointed to the National Security Commission on Emerging Biotechnology.</li>
<li>Advocated for government-backed research funding and increased research dollars for the Midwest.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Appropriations Committee Member:</strong> Representative Bice's position on the House Committee on Appropriations provides direct influence over federal spending, including NASA's budget, indicating a key opportunity to advocate for science investments.</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for NASA Science Funding:</strong> She explicitly stated that "Any significant cuts to NASA's science funding would not only impact our space economy and workforce but could threaten our national security and technological leadership position" on National Space Day. (Congress.gov, 2025-05)</li>
<li><strong>Local NASA Science Investments:</strong> Her district benefits from NASA Science Mission Directorate grants, including Lumenus Scientific LLC for Earth science and Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation for biological and physical sciences, demonstrating direct local economic and research ties. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Support for Biotechnology and Research:</strong> As a member of the National Security Commission on Emerging Biotechnology, she co-introduced the bipartisan National Biotechnology Initiative Act of 2025, advocating for federal investment in biotechnology, which includes biological sciences relevant to NASA. (Biotech, 2025-04)</li>
<li><strong>Support for NASA Exploration and Local Industry:</strong> Representative Bice expressed honor that "America's next chapter in space will be supported by Oklahomans" following Canoo's selection by NASA for Artemis mission vehicle transport. (Stephanie Bice, 2022-04)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism and Appropriations Vote:</strong> Representative Bice voted in favor of the House-passed FY2024 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act (H.R. 4366), which proposed a reduction in NASA's overall budget compared to the previous fiscal year, including cuts to science programs.</li>
<li><strong>General Fiscal Responsibility Stance:</strong> Representative Bice has consistently supported legislation aimed at reducing federal spending and promoting fiscal responsibility, indicating a general inclination towards budget restraint that could impact future NASA science funding levels.</li>
<li><strong>Competing Priorities (Defense Spending):</strong> As a member of the House Appropriations Committee, Representative Bice has publicly emphasized her commitment to ensuring the military has necessary resources, highlighting defense spending as a key priority that may compete with non-defense discretionary programs like NASA science.</li>
