    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.

<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Bonamici appears receptive to NASA's Earth science activities, evidenced by her co-sponsorship of the ASCEND Act and engagement with NASA Administrator Nelson on climate research and the PACE satellite. Her district also benefits from NASA grants for climate analysis and astrobiology research at Portland State University, suggesting a local connection to scientific endeavors.</p>
<p>However, advocates should note that while she supports federal science agencies, her public record does not consistently feature explicit calls for significant <em>increases</em> in NASA's overall science budget, focusing more on maintaining robust funding. Her primary legislative priorities also lean towards education, healthcare, and climate change, indicating that space science, while valued, may not be a top-tier focus compared to other issues.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider highlighting specific NASA science grants within her district, such as the climate analysis and astrobiology research at Portland State University or the wildfire mapping project with the Western Fire Chiefs Association, to demonstrate direct local benefits and align with her interest in climate.</li>
<li>Explore how increased investment in NASA's space science activities, particularly Earth science, directly supports her stated priorities on climate change and strengthens the broader scientific enterprise she championed through the CHIPS and Science Act.</li>
<li>Look into how NASA's space science, especially Earth observation data, can provide actionable insights that address her key priorities like climate resilience, economic opportunity through technological innovation, and even consumer protection through improved forecasting and resource management.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Suzanne Bonamici</h2>
<ul>
<li>Earned associate, bachelor's, and law degrees from Oregon institutions.</li>
<li>Practiced law, including consumer protection for the Federal Trade Commission.</li>
<li>Served in the Oregon House of Representatives and State Senate.</li>
<li>Sponsored the Tsunami Warning, Education, and Research Act of 2014.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Advocacy for NASA Earth Science Data:</strong> Representative Bonamici co-sponsored and saw the House pass the bipartisan Accessing Satellite Capabilities to Enable New Discoveries (ASCEND) Act (H.R. 6219), which permanently authorizes NASA's Commercial SmallSat Data Acquisition program within the Earth Science Division, ensuring continued access to commercial Earth remote sensing data for scientific research. This directly benefits researchers, including those at Portland State University in her district who received a NASA grant for climate analysis. (House.gov, 2024-09; USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Engagement on NASA's Earth Science Budget and Strategy:</strong> During a May 2024 House Science, Space, and Technology Committee hearing, Representative Bonamici questioned NASA Administrator Bill Nelson on NASA's climate and Earth science research, expressing excitement for the PACE satellite and concern regarding the potential impact of budget restructuring on long-term Earth measurements and climate research. (Forbes, 2024-05)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support for Local NASA-Funded Scientific Research:</strong> Her district includes Portland State University, which received NASA grants totaling over $1.5 million for scientific research, including analysis of climate at grid point through regional scales and astrobiology research on the evolution of microbial sulfur assimilation. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Commitment to Broader Scientific Enterprise:</strong> Representative Bonamici helped negotiate and pass the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, which aims to strengthen the U.S. scientific enterprise and bolster research and development, benefiting technology leaders like Intel in her district. (House.gov, 2024-08)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bipartisan Action on Climate-Related Earth Science:</strong> In January 2025, Representative Bonamici co-reintroduced the bipartisan Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Amendments (HABHRCA) Act of 2025, which reauthorizes a program to improve monitoring and mitigation of harmful algal blooms and hypoxia, explicitly linking these efforts to climate change and the need for research. (House.gov, 2025-01)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competing Priorities Focus:</strong> Representative Bonamici's official website prominently lists education, healthcare, climate change, and economic opportunity as key legislative priorities, which may indicate that space science, while supported, is not a top-tier focus when compared to other issues. (SuzanneBonamici.house.gov, 2025-01)</li>
<li><strong>Absence of Explicit Advocacy for Budget Growth:</strong> While she has expressed general support for federal science agencies and NASA's scientific endeavors, her public record does not consistently feature explicit calls for significant <em>increases</em> in NASA's overall science budget, focusing more on maintaining robust funding. (SuzanneBonamici.house.gov, 2024-03; Oregonian, 2023-07)</li>
