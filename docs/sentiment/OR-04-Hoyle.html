<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Hoyle's legislative priorities primarily revolve around social and economic issues, and she lacks a direct committee assignment for space policy, suggesting a limited focus on NASA's broader science mission. While her district benefits from significant NASA Earth science funding for climate and environmental research at local universities, there is less public record of her explicit support for astrophysics, planetary science, or heliophysics, which are also facing severe proposed cuts. Her general fiscal scrutiny of federal spending could also make her cautious about increasing overall NASA science investments.</p>
<p>However, her consistent advocacy for federal science, particularly for weather prediction and climate research, aligns well with NASA's Earth science activities. The substantial NASA grants to Oregon State and the University of Oregon in her district provide a strong local economic and scientific rationale for maintaining or increasing funding. Advocates could effectively frame the broader NASA science budget cuts as detrimental to the Earth science programs she champions and to the research institutions in her district, leveraging her commitment to ensuring appropriated funds reach intended programs.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider highlighting specific NASA science grants and contracts to Oregon State University and the University of Oregon, demonstrating how these investments directly benefit the 4th district's economy, research institutions, and address local environmental and climate challenges.</li>
<li>Explore how increased investment in NASA's broader science portfolio, beyond just Earth science, contributes to the foundational research necessary for improving weather prediction and understanding climate change, aligning with her advocacy for NOAA and environmental issues.</li>
<li>Look into Representative Hoyle's specific concerns regarding federal spending and be prepared to articulate the long-term economic and societal returns on investment in NASA science, framing it as a strategic investment that supports STEM jobs and innovation in Oregon.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Val T. Hoyle</h2>
<ul>
<li>Earned a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science from Emmanuel College.</li>
<li>Served multiple terms in the Oregon House of Representatives, including Majority Leader.</li>
<li>Elected Oregon's Labor Commissioner, overseeing labor laws and apprenticeship programs.</li>
<li>Worked in sales and marketing for bicycle manufacturers Burley Design and Cane Creek.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Support for Federal Science for Weather Prediction:</strong> Representative Hoyle co-signed a bipartisan letter advocating for increased funding for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) next-generation weather prediction systems, including advancements in forecasting technology and research, citing Oregon's experience with extreme weather. This aligns with NASA's Earth science activities, which contribute to climate and weather understanding.</li>
<li><strong>Engagement with Community Project Funding:</strong> Representative Hoyle actively solicits and submits Community Project Funding requests to the House Appropriations Committee, including for accounts like Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies, demonstrating a mechanism for directing federal funds to local priorities. Oregon State University and the University of Oregon, both in her district, receive significant NASA Earth science grants for projects such as ocean color calibration and tsunami loss estimation. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for Research Universities:</strong> Representative Hoyle emphasizes the value of investing in higher education and notes that her district is home to top research institutions like the University of Oregon and Oregon State University, which are key partners in federal research. These universities are direct recipients of NASA science grants for Earth science research. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Focus on Climate and Environmental Research:</strong> Representative Hoyle's stated priorities include addressing climate change and environmental degradation, and she has supported initiatives related to wildfire safety. Many NASA Earth science programs, including those with grants to Oregon institutions for forest carbon mapping and marine biodiversity, directly contribute to these areas. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Stance Against Withholding Appropriated Funds:</strong> Representative Hoyle testified before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government, urging them to hold the Executive Branch accountable for withholding congressionally appropriated funds, indicating a commitment to ensuring federal funding reaches intended programs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competing Legislative Priorities:</strong> Representative Hoyle's public statements and campaign priorities consistently emphasize reproductive rights, affordable housing, healthcare, labor issues, and local economic development, which may compete for her attention and advocacy over increased NASA science investment.</li>
<li><strong>Absence of Space-Specific Committee Assignments:</strong> Representative Hoyle does not hold a current assignment on a committee directly overseeing NASA or space science, which may limit her direct influence or platform for championing these specific issues. (Authoritative <code>&lt;space_committees&gt;</code> data)</li>
<li><strong>Primary Focus on Earth Science Applications:</strong> While her district benefits from NASA Earth science contracts and she actively advocates for climate and environmental research, there is less public record of her explicit support for other NASA Science Mission Directorate areas such as astrophysics, planetary science, or heliophysics. [cite: USAspending, FY2022-FY2024, 5, 13]</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal Scrutiny of Federal Spending:</strong> Representative Hoyle has expressed concerns about federal budget processes and opposed bills that she states "explode the national deficit," indicating a general posture of scrutinizing federal expenditures, which could extend to new large investments in space science.</li>
