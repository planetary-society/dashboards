<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology</li>
<li>Member, House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology: Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Salinas's strong focus on healthcare and environmental protection, coupled with expressed concerns about fiscal responsibility, suggests potential headwinds for advocating significant increases across all NASA science disciplines. Her district's minimal direct economic ties to NASA's Science Mission Directorate, as indicated by very low contract values, may also limit a strong local incentive for broad science funding. While she supports federal research generally, her emphasis on applied science and workforce development might prioritize programs with more immediate economic or environmental impacts over fundamental astrophysics or planetary science.</p>
<p>However, her critical role on the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology and its Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee provides a direct and essential platform for engaging with NASA's budget and mission. Her co-sponsorship of "National Moon Landing Day" and general statements supporting federal research and STEM indicate an openness to space exploration and scientific endeavor. Advocates have a clear opportunity to highlight how diverse NASA science investments drive innovation, inspire future generations, and contribute to the nation's scientific leadership, potentially aligning with her broader goals for an innovation economy and workforce development.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider exploring specific examples of how NASA's broader science activities, beyond Earth science, contribute to the innovation economy, workforce development, or even health-related technological advancements, to connect with her stated priorities.</li>
<li>Look into specific examples of students, researchers, or small businesses in Oregon's 6th District who have benefited from NASA science funding or programs, particularly through the Oregon NASA Space Grant Consortium, to highlight local impact.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's fundamental science research, including areas beyond Earth science, ultimately drives technological innovation and workforce development that aligns with her interest in the "innovation economy" and applied science benefits.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Andrea Salinas</h2>
<ul>
<li>Graduated from the University of California, Berkeley.</li>
<li>Served as legislative director for the Oregon Environmental Council.</li>
<li>Worked as a legislative aide for U.S. Senator Harry Reid and two U.S. Representatives.</li>
<li>Chaired the Oregon House Committee on Health Care, focusing on health science policy.</li>
<li>Previously worked as a federal and state lobbyist, and in political consulting.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Committee Assignment:</strong> Representative Salinas serves on the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology and its Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee, which directly oversees NASA's Science Mission Directorate activities and exploration programs. This assignment provides a direct platform for advocating for NASA science.</li>
<li><strong>Support for Space Exploration and STEM:</strong> Representative Salinas co-sponsored a bipartisan resolution establishing "National Moon Landing Day" in July 2025, emphasizing the importance of NASA's Artemis program and inspiring the next generation in STEM fields. This indicates support for broader space exploration goals that often align with science objectives.</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for Federal Research Investments:</strong> Representative Salinas has publicly stated that "Federal research investments drive innovation, create jobs, and protect our communities" and that "Science is not a partisan issue." This general support for scientific research suggests openness to increased investment in NASA's science activities.</li>
<li><strong>Local University NASA Affiliations:</strong> Oregon State University and the University of Oregon, located within or near Oregon's 6th Congressional District, are lead institutions or affiliates of the Oregon NASA Space Grant Consortium, which promotes STEM education and research aligned with NASA's strategic goals. This provides a local connection to NASA-funded science and education initiatives.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on Innovation Economy and Workforce Development:</strong> Representative Salinas emphasizes ensuring Oregonians benefit from the "innovation economy of the future" and has worked on legislation for workforce development in quantum science and artificial intelligence. This aligns with the advanced technological and scientific workforce development often supported by NASA's science and exploration programs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competing Priorities (Healthcare):</strong> Representative Salinas has consistently prioritized affordable and accessible healthcare, including voting against a Republican spending bill due to concerns about healthcare cuts, which could lead to a preference for healthcare funding over increased NASA science investments in budget negotiations.</li>
<li><strong>Competing Priorities (Environmental Science Focus):</strong> Her strong emphasis on environmental protection, clean energy, and combating climate change, including leveraging her Science, Space, and Technology Committee role for environmental legislation, may lead to a greater focus on Earth science within NASA's portfolio rather than other science disciplines or exploration programs.</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal Responsibility Concerns:</strong> Representative Salinas has expressed concerns about the national debt and the need to move towards a balanced budget, which could make her cautious about advocating for significant increases in federal spending, including for NASA science activities.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Direct Local Economic Ties to NASA SMD/Exploration:</strong> While her district has general tech and aerospace businesses, the provided contract data does not indicate significant direct economic ties specifically to NASA's Science Mission Directorate activities or exploration programs, potentially reducing a strong local advocacy driver for these specific areas. [cite: <contracts>]</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on Applied Science and Workforce Development:</strong> Her public statements often highlight science's role in the "innovation economy," "good-paying jobs," and "workforce development," which might lead to a preference for applied science and technology programs with more immediate economic impacts over fundamental research in areas like astrophysics or planetary science.</li>
