<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, Senate Committee on Appropriations</li>
<li>Member, Senate Committee on Appropriations: Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Senator Jeff Merkley's position on the Senate Appropriations Committee and its Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee provides a direct avenue for influencing NASA's budget, with the committee recently recommending an increase for the agency. His consistent advocacy for federal scientific research, including defending ocean observing systems vital to Oregon's coastal communities, aligns strongly with NASA's Earth science objectives. Furthermore, Oregon universities receive significant NASA grants primarily for Earth science research, establishing a clear local connection to this specific area of the Science Mission Directorate.</p>
<p>However, Senator Merkley's legislative priorities are heavily focused on domestic social and economic issues, which may compete with increased investment in broader NASA science. While he has demonstrated support for Earth science, there is no public record of substantial local economic ties or specific advocacy for NASA's astrophysics, planetary science, heliophysics, or biological and physical sciences programs. Advocates should be prepared to articulate the value of these diverse science missions to Oregon's interests, especially in light of past fiscal scrutiny on large NASA projects and the significant proposed FY2026 budget cuts.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider highlighting the direct benefits of NASA's Earth science investments to Oregon, specifically referencing the research at Oregon State University and the University of Oregon on ocean observing, forest carbon, and tsunami preparedness, which align with his advocacy for coastal communities and scientific research.</li>
<li>Explore how increased investment in NASA's science activities can address issues Senator Merkley prioritizes, such as climate change impacts, public health through environmental monitoring, or fostering innovation and workforce development within Oregon's research institutions.</li>
<li>Look into his past statements or actions regarding federal research funding and fiscal oversight, preparing to frame the request for NASA science investment as a responsible and high-return use of taxpayer dollars, particularly given his role on the Appropriations Committee.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Jeff Merkley</h2>
<ul>
<li>Earned degrees from Stanford University (BA) and Princeton University (MPA).</li>
<li>Presidential Management Fellow, analyzing military technology security for Defense Department.</li>
<li>Congressional Budget Office analyst, focused on nuclear weapons policies and programs.</li>
<li>Served as Oregon State Representative, including two years as Speaker.</li>
<li>Elected U.S. Senator for Oregon in 2008; reelected in 2014 and 2020.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Appropriations Committee Leadership:</strong> As a member of the Senate Committee on Appropriations and its Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee, Senator Merkley is part of the body that recommended increasing NASA's funding by $559 million in the FY2025 appropriations bill, indicating a supportive posture toward the agency's budget.</li>
<li><strong>Defense of Ocean Observing Systems:</strong> Senator Merkley co-signed a letter in June 2025, expressing strong concern over a budget proposal to eliminate federal funding for the U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS), highlighting its critical importance for Oregon's coastal communities and maritime economy, which aligns with NASA's Earth science objectives.</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for Federal Scientific Research:</strong> In March 2025, Senator Merkley, as a ranking member of an Appropriations Subcommittee, opposed proposed cuts to the EPA's Office of Research and Development, emphasizing the necessity of independent scientific research for public health and environmental protection.</li>
<li><strong>Local NASA Earth Science Investments:</strong> Oregon State University and the University of Oregon have received multiple NASA grants and contracts totaling over $11 million for Earth science research, including ocean observation, marine biodiversity, forest carbon monitoring, and tsunami preparedness, demonstrating significant local engagement with NASA's Science Mission Directorate. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competing Domestic Priorities:</strong> Senator Merkley's legislative agenda heavily emphasizes social and economic issues such as housing, healthcare, and wildfire relief, which may divert his primary advocacy focus from increased investment in NASA science and exploration. (Senator Jeff Merkley, Legislative Priorities; Senator Jeff Merkley, 24 Accomplishments in 2024)</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal Scrutiny of Large Projects:</strong> Senator Merkley has demonstrated a posture of fiscal scrutiny, including a 2019 letter from the Senate Budget Committee expressing concern over cost growth and schedule delays in major NASA projects like the James Webb Space Telescope and Space Launch System. (Senate Budget Committee, 2019-07)</li>
<li><strong>Limited Direct Local Economic Ties to Non-Earth Science/Exploration:</strong> While Oregon receives significant NASA grants primarily for Earth science activities, there is no public record of substantial direct local economic ties or contracts specifically related to NASA's astrophysics, planetary science, heliophysics, biological and physical sciences, or human exploration programs, which could limit his proactive advocacy for these areas. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
