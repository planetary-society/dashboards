<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Fitzpatrick's lack of direct committee involvement in space policy and the minimal local economic ties to NASA's Science Mission Directorate present initial hurdles for advocating increased funding. His focus on space as critical infrastructure for national security and economic stability, rather than pure scientific discovery, may also temper enthusiasm for these specific programs. Furthermore, his record of fiscal conservatism and support for other scientific priorities like the National Science Foundation and National Cancer Institute suggest competing demands for federal investment.</p>
<p>However, there are avenues for engagement. His strong record on environmental stewardship and membership in the Climate Solutions Caucus align well with NASA's Earth science research, offering a potential entry point for discussion. Additionally, his consistent support for STEM workforce development and a general pro-science stance, coupled with a bipartisan approach to policy, indicate an openness to scientific endeavors. Advocates can highlight how NASA's science activities contribute to a skilled workforce and address environmental challenges relevant to his district.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Explore how NASA's Earth science research and data, particularly concerning climate monitoring or environmental health, directly relate to or could assist with specific environmental challenges in Representative Fitzpatrick's district, such as PFAS contamination.</li>
<li>Consider identifying specific examples of how NASA's broader scientific endeavors create demand for skilled STEM professionals or support local businesses in PA-01, even those providing general technical services, to align with his focus on workforce development.</li>
<li>Look into how NASA's foundational space science research, including areas like space weather prediction or advanced technology development, underpins the resilience and security of the space infrastructure that Representative Fitzpatrick has championed.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Brian K. Fitzpatrick</h2>
<ul>
<li>Holds a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration, an MBA, and a Juris Doctor.</li>
<li>Served as a former FBI supervisory special agent and federal prosecutor.</li>
<li>Embedded with U.S. Special Forces during Operation Iraqi Freedom.</li>
<li>Member of the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus, addressing environmental issues.</li>
<li>Recognized as the most environmentally friendly House Republican by League of Conservation Voters.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>STEM Workforce Development:</strong> Representative Fitzpatrick recently co-sponsored the MAKERS Act (January 2025) and the Supporting Diverse STEM Students Act (October 2024), demonstrating a commitment to fostering a skilled workforce crucial for scientific and technological advancements, including those relevant to NASA. Local businesses in PA-01, such as Hawks Technical Services LLC and Powers Scientific Inc., received NASA contracts for specialized equipment like a deep reactive ion etch system and a diurnal plant growth incubator, indicating a local connection to scientific infrastructure that benefits from STEM talent. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Environmental Stewardship &amp; Earth Science:</strong> As a member of the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus and recognized for his environmental record, Representative Fitzpatrick supports policies addressing climate change and environmental protection, which aligns with NASA's Earth science research. (Biography; Brian Fitzpatrick For Congress, Undated) His focus on addressing local PFAS contamination issues in his district further demonstrates a practical engagement with environmental challenges that NASA Earth science can help monitor and understand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Recognition of Space Assets:</strong> In July 2023, Representative Fitzpatrick introduced the bipartisan Space Infrastructure Act, which seeks to designate space systems, services, and technology as a critical infrastructure sector, highlighting his understanding of the strategic importance of space assets for national security and the economy. This indicates an appreciation for the broader space enterprise, which often relies on foundational NASA research and development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Broad Support for Scientific Research:</strong> Representative Fitzpatrick recently co-sponsored a resolution designating Medical Research Week in September 2025, signaling a general pro-science stance and recognizing the importance of research for societal benefit and economic growth. This general support for scientific inquiry can extend to various fields, including those within NASA's Science Mission Directorate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bipartisan Approach to Policy:</strong> Representative Fitzpatrick has a consistent record of bipartisan collaboration on various legislative initiatives, including those related to science and technology, suggesting an openness to working across the aisle to secure funding and support for NASA science. His emphasis on "Delivering results—for One Community, For All of Us" (Brian Fitzpatrick For Congress, Undated) indicates a pragmatic approach to securing benefits for his district, which could include federal science investments.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of Direct Space Committee Role:</strong> Representative Fitzpatrick holds no current space-related committee assignments in the 119th Congress, limiting his direct influence on NASA's space science and exploration budgets and policies. (Authoritative Committee Data)</li>
<li><strong>Limited Local Economic Ties to NASA Science/Exploration:</strong> The contracts awarded in his district are small-value and for general equipment and maintenance, not directly tied to NASA's Science Mission Directorate activities or exploration programs, suggesting a lack of strong local economic drivers for these specific areas. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Competing Science Funding Priorities:</strong> Representative Fitzpatrick has actively championed increased funding for the National Science Foundation and the National Cancer Institute, indicating a focus on other scientific research areas that may compete for federal investment. (AIBS, 2024-03; AIBS, 2025-04; Rep. Fitzpatrick Press Release, 2025-06)</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism and Broader Budgetary Concerns:</strong> Representative Fitzpatrick has engaged in votes on appropriations and budget bills, and co-sponsored legislation for fiscal responsibility, indicating a general posture of balancing federal spending priorities that could impact NASA's budget. (Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick Press Release, 2024-03; Bucks County Beacon, 2025-05; BillTrack50, 2025; Bucks County Beacon, 2025-04)</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on Space as Critical Infrastructure:</strong> Representative Fitzpatrick co-introduced legislation to designate space systems as critical infrastructure, highlighting a focus on national security and economic stability aspects of space rather than purely scientific or exploration goals. (Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick Press Release, 2023-07)</li>
