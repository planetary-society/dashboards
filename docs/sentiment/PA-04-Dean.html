<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Appropriations</li>
<li>Member, House Committee on Appropriations: Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Dean's public record indicates a primary focus on domestic priorities such as healthcare and education, and she lacks a direct STEM background, which might suggest space science is not an inherent top priority. While her district benefits from some NASA contracts and grants, these economic ties are modest, potentially limiting strong local pressure for significant increases. The proposed 47% cut to NASA's Science Mission Directorate in FY2026 represents a substantial hurdle.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, Representative Dean's role on the House Appropriations Committee and its Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee places her in a critical position to influence NASA's budget. Notably, she joined the Democratic opposition to the FY2026 CJS bill specifically due to proposed cuts to NASA's science account, directly aligning with the goal of preventing such reductions. This, coupled with her general support for federal research and proactive approach to securing grants, suggests she could be receptive to advocacy for robust investment in space science.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider highlighting the specific NASA science contracts and grants in her district, such as those at Fed Crew Inc, Advanced Dicing Technologies, Ursinus College, and Kutztown University, to demonstrate direct local economic and educational benefits.</li>
<li>Explore how increased investment in NASA's science activities aligns with her stated opposition to cuts in science funding during CJS Subcommittee markups and her general support for federal research investments.</li>
<li>Look into connecting NASA's space science missions to broader societal benefits that resonate with her focus areas, such as advancements in environmental monitoring, technological innovation, or inspiring STEM education for students in her district.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Madeleine Dean</h2>
<ul>
<li>Earned degrees from La Salle University and Widener University Delaware Law School.</li>
<li>Practiced law and served as in-house counsel for a bicycle business.</li>
<li>Taught English and ethics as an assistant professor at La Salle University.</li>
<li>Served in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, focusing on social issues.</li>
<li>No direct STEM or space-related professional background or education is publicly recorded.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Appropriations Committee Leadership:</strong> As a member of the House Committee on Appropriations and its Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (CJS) Subcommittee, Representative Dean holds a direct position to influence NASA's budget, including its science mission directorate.</li>
<li><strong>Local NASA Contracts and Grants:</strong> Several entities within her district, including Fed Crew Inc, Advanced Dicing Technologies Inc, Ursinus College, and Kutztown University of Pennsylvania, have received NASA contracts and grants for research and specialized equipment, demonstrating direct local economic and research benefits.</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for Research Funding:</strong> Representative Dean has filed amendments to restore funding for "medical research" and stated that a budget should not "cut life-saving healthcare research," indicating a general commitment to federal research investments.</li>
<li><strong>Opposition to CJS Science Cuts:</strong> During the FY2026 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee markup, the Democratic position, consistent with Representative Dean's role on the subcommittee, voiced strong opposition to proposed cuts to NASA's science account, arguing such cuts would cause the U.S. to "fall behind" and advocating for increased investments in science.</li>
<li><strong>Facilitation of Federal Grants:</strong> Her official website provides resources and encourages constituents to apply for federal grant opportunities, including those from landmark legislation like the CHIPS and Science Act, demonstrating a proactive approach to securing federal funding for science and technology.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Limited Direct STEM/Space Background:</strong> Representative Dean's public biography does not indicate a professional or educational background in STEM or space, which may suggest a lack of inherent prioritization for space science activities. (Biography)</li>
<li><strong>Strong Focus on Competing Domestic Priorities:</strong> Representative Dean consistently emphasizes funding for social programs, healthcare, education, and environmental protection in her public statements regarding budget votes, indicating these areas may take precedence over increased NASA science investment.</li>
<li><strong>Opposition to NASA Science Cuts within CJS Subcommittee:</strong> As a member of the House Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (CJS) Appropriations Subcommittee, Representative Dean was part of the Democratic minority that voted against the FY2026 CJS bill due to a proposed $1.3 billion cut to NASA's science funding.</li>
<li><strong>Modest Local NASA Economic Ties:</strong> Her district has received NASA contracts and grants for specific equipment and academic research, totaling approximately $495K in contracts and $154K in grants, which are relatively modest in scope and may result in less direct local advocacy for significant increases in NASA science funding. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
