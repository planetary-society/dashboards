<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Perry's consistent advocacy for reduced federal spending and his affiliation with the House Freedom Caucus suggest a strong inclination against increasing discretionary appropriations, including for NASA science. His public record of skepticism toward Earth science funding and a vote against related legislation further indicate potential resistance to a significant portion of NASA's Science Mission Directorate. The limited direct economic ties from NASA science activities within his district, totaling only $108,000 over three years, may also reduce local incentive for increased investment.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, Representative Perry's background as a military helicopter pilot, coupled with his family's aviation ties and experience co-founding a mechanical contracting business, could foster an appreciation for advanced technology, engineering, and innovation. Advocates might find receptiveness by framing NASA science as a strategic investment in American technological leadership, national security, and long-term economic competitiveness, rather than solely as federal spending. The small local university grant and manufacturing contract, while minor, offer tangible examples of NASA's reach into his district that could be highlighted.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider how NASA's scientific advancements, particularly in areas like satellite technology or atmospheric research, contribute to national security and aviation safety, drawing parallels to Representative Perry's extensive military and aviation background and family history.</li>
<li>Explore how the specific NASA-funded projects at Harrisburg University and Penn-Air &amp; Hydraulics in his district demonstrate local innovation and specialized technical capabilities, highlighting how increased NASA science investment could expand these regional opportunities.</li>
<li>Look into how NASA's scientific research drives technological innovation that benefits private industry, creates new markets, and provides a strong return on investment for taxpayers, aligning with Representative Perry's business background and fiscal conservatism.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Scott Perry</h2>
<ul>
<li>Retired Brigadier General, Pennsylvania Army National Guard, with 39 years of service.</li>
<li>Qualified helicopter pilot and instructor pilot, flying multiple military aircraft.</li>

</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local University Research:</strong> Harrisburg University of Science &amp; Technology in Representative Perry's district received a NASA grant for "science tracking across the project lifespan," indicating a local connection to scientific research and development supported by NASA. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Local High-Tech Manufacturing:</strong> Penn-Air &amp; Hydraulics Corp in Representative Perry's district received a NASA contract for a custom enclosure for a laser table, demonstrating local involvement in specialized manufacturing that supports scientific and technical applications. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Aerospace and Technical Background:</strong> Representative Perry's extensive career as a military helicopter pilot and instructor pilot, coupled with his family's aviation background, suggests a foundational understanding and appreciation for advanced technology and complex engineering systems inherent in NASA's scientific and exploration missions. (Biography)</li>
<li><strong>Business and Innovation Experience:</strong> As a co-founder of a mechanical contracting business, Representative Perry has direct experience with technical problem-solving and business operations, which could lead to an appreciation for the technological advancements and economic benefits generated by NASA's scientific investments. (Biography)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Representative Perry consistently advocates for reduced federal spending and a balanced budget, having re-introduced a Balanced Budget Amendment in January 2025 and stating that "Washington doesn't have a revenue problem – it has a spending problem." He also voted against bipartisan spending packages to avert government shutdowns in March 2024, citing concerns about spending money the country does not have.</li>
<li><strong>Opposition to Earth Science Funding:</strong> Representative Perry has a public record of skepticism toward established climate change science and voted against the Weather Act Reauthorization Act of 2023, which aimed to modernize NOAA's weather forecasting and satellite observation systems.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Space-Related Committee Assignments:</strong> Representative Perry holds no current space-related committee assignments in the 119th Congress, which may limit his direct engagement with or influence over NASA's budget and policy.</li>
<li><strong>House Freedom Caucus Affiliation:</strong> As a former Chairman (served through 2023) and member of the House Freedom Caucus, Representative Perry aligns with a group that advocates for limited government and significant spending cuts, potentially impacting discretionary programs like NASA science.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Direct Local NASA Science Economic Ties:</strong> The contracts and grants identified in Representative Perry's district are minor and do not directly tie to core NASA Science Mission Directorate activities, potentially reducing local economic incentives for increased NASA science investment.
