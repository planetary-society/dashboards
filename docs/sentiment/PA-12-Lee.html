<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Summer Lee has demonstrated a clear interest in NASA's activities, particularly where they intersect with her district's economic and educational landscape. Her vocal opposition to proposed NASA budget cuts, which she characterized as an "attack on Brilliant Minds" and innovative businesses in her district, suggests a receptiveness to maintaining space investment. Furthermore, her active role in securing significant funding for local space companies like Astrobotic Technology Inc. and her stated commitment to bringing research dollars to Western PA institutions highlight a strong alignment with the goals of increased NASA science funding.</p>
<p>Despite these positive indicators, advocates should be mindful of Representative Lee's lack of current space-related committee assignments, which may limit her direct legislative influence. Her broader legislative priorities often center on competing domestic issues such as social programs and infrastructure, and she has expressed general concerns about federal spending. Therefore, while there is a guardedly optimistic outlook due to the substantial NASA science contracts and grants flowing into her district, advocates should clearly articulate how increased NASA science funding directly benefits her constituents through job creation, research opportunities, and STEM education, especially in light of the proposed FY26 budget cuts.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching specific NASA science projects funded in Representative Lee's district, particularly those at Astrobotic, Carnegie Mellon, and the University of Pittsburgh, to illustrate how these investments directly support local jobs and economic growth.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA science initiatives, especially those involving local universities, inspire students and contribute to STEM workforce development in her district, aligning with her past engagement in robotics classrooms and the Keystone Space Collaborative.</li>
<li>Look into how NASA's Earth science missions, and potentially other science disciplines, provide data and insights that address environmental justice concerns or offer direct societal benefits relevant to the communities in her district.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Summer L. Lee</h2>

</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>District's Economic Stake in NASA:</strong> Representative Lee's district has a significant economic interest in NASA's activities, having received over $58 million in NASA contracts for Fiscal Year 2023 across 19 businesses and universities, including major awards to Astrobotic Technology Inc. for lunar missions and grants to Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh for science research. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Vocal Opposition to NASA Budget Reductions:</strong> In a May 2024 House Science, Space &amp; Technology Committee hearing, Representative Lee publicly criticized proposed budget cuts to NASA, stating that such reductions are an "attack on the Brilliant Minds" and innovative businesses in her district that contribute to American leadership in space exploration and technological development. (Forbes, 2024-05)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Championing Local Space Industry Expansion:</strong> Representative Lee was recognized in November 2023 for her role in securing $35 million for Astrobotic Technology Inc., a Pittsburgh-based company with significant NASA contracts for lunar missions, an action praised by local officials for fostering job creation and innovation. (TribLive, 2023-11)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Promoting STEM Education and Workforce Development:</strong> In June 2023, Representative Lee engaged directly with NASA's mission by participating in a "space tour" in Pittsburgh with NASA Deputy Administrator Pam Melroy, visiting a middle school robotics classroom to encourage students in STEM fields and attending the Keystone Space Collaborative Conference. (CBS News, 2023-06)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Prior Commitment to Science and Technology Funding:</strong> Upon her appointment to the House Science, Space and Technology Committee in the 118th Congress (January 2023), Representative Lee explicitly stated her intention to "deliver funding to fuel Western PA innovation, bring research dollars back to our institutions, and break down barriers to Black, brown, and marginalized folks in STEM." (Congresswoman Summer Lee Press Release, 2023-01)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>No Current Space-Related Committee Assignments:</strong> Representative Lee does not hold any committee assignments directly related to space, science, or technology in the 119th Congress, which may limit her direct legislative influence on NASA science funding. [cite: AUTHORITATIVE COMMITTEE DATA]</li>
<li><strong>Strong Focus on Competing Domestic Priorities:</strong> Representative Lee consistently prioritizes federal funding for social programs, affordable housing, healthcare, education, and infrastructure, which could compete with increased investment in NASA science activities.</li>
<li><strong>General Opposition to "Bloated" Federal Spending:</strong> Representative Lee has expressed concerns about "bloated military spending" and opposed budget packages that she views as harmful to working families, indicating a general fiscal scrutiny that could extend to non-essential federal expenditures.</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on Environmental Justice within Climate Action:</strong> While supportive of climate action, Representative Lee's public statements often emphasize environmental justice and local community impacts, which might lead her to prioritize Earth science initiatives with direct community benefits over broader, fundamental Earth science research.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Direct STEM or Space-Related Professional Background:</strong> Representative Lee's biography indicates no public record of direct professional experience in STEM or space-related fields, which might mean less inherent personal advocacy for these areas compared to those with such backgrounds.
