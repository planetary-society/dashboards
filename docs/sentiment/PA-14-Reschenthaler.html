<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Appropriations</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Reschenthaler's consistent emphasis on fiscal conservatism and reducing government spending, coupled with his skepticism toward climate and Earth science funding, suggests a challenging environment for advocating increased NASA science investment. His alignment with potential executive branch budget cuts, which could target science, further complicates efforts to secure funding, especially given the proposed 47% cut in FY2026.</p>
<p>However, his public statements acknowledging that cuts to NASA science impact national security, technological leadership, and the space economy provide an important point of engagement. The significant NASA contracts awarded to Ansys Inc. in his district, totaling over $4.5 million for essential engineering software, offer a strong local economic argument for supporting the Science Mission Directorate. As a member of the House Appropriations Committee, he holds a critical position to influence these funding decisions.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching the specific jobs and economic impact of Ansys Inc.'s NASA contracts in Canonsburg, PA, to illustrate how NASA science investment directly supports local constituents and the district's economy.</li>
<li>Explore specific examples of how NASA's space science activities, such as Earth observation for national security or advanced technology development, contribute to America's technological leadership and national defense, aligning with his military background and stated priorities.</li>
<li>Look into how NASA science investments yield tangible returns, such as technological spin-offs benefiting various industries or advancements that improve daily life, to demonstrate the efficiency and value of these federal expenditures.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Guy Reschenthaler</h2>
<ul>
<li>Graduated from Penn State Erie, The Behrend College (BA Political Science, 2004).</li>
<li>Earned a Juris Doctor (JD) degree from Duquesne University School of Law (2007).</li>
<li>Served in the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps (JAG) during the Iraq War.</li>
<li>Practiced law and served as a magisterial district judge in Pennsylvania.</li>
<li>Previously served as a member of the Pennsylvania State Senate.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advocacy for NASA Science Funding:</strong> Representative Reschenthaler has publicly stated that "Any significant cuts to NASA's science funding would not only impact our space economy and workforce but could threaten our national security and technological leadership position," indicating an understanding of the broader benefits of NASA science. (Congressional Record, 2025-05-05)</li>
<li><strong>Local Economic Benefit from NASA Contracts:</strong> His district benefits from NASA contracts, such as multiple awards totaling over $4.5 million to Ansys Inc. in Canonsburg, PA, for essential engineering software and maintenance that supports various NASA missions, including science and exploration. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Appropriations Committee Influence:</strong> As a Member of the House Committee on Appropriations, Representative Reschenthaler holds a direct position to influence federal spending decisions, including the allocation of funds for NASA's Science Mission Directorate and exploration programs. (Authoritative Committee Data)</li>
<li><strong>Support for U.S. Space Preeminence:</strong> He has emphasized the importance of maintaining "America's preeminence in space" and linked space exploration to "real benefits to our daily lives," suggesting a foundational appreciation for space activities that could extend to science. (Congressional Record, 2025-05-05)</li>
<li><strong>Bipartisan Engagement on Space Issues:</strong> His participation in a Congressional Record statement commemorating National Space Day, which often involves bipartisan support, suggests a willingness to engage in collaborative efforts related to space. (Congressional Record, 2025-05-05)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Representative Reschenthaler consistently emphasizes reducing "out-of-control government spending" and rooting out "waste, corruption, and abuse," indicating a general inclination to limit federal expenditures that could impact NASA's budget. (Reschenthaler Statement, 2025-03; Reschenthaler Statement, 2025-07; The Freedom Index, 2022-12)</li>
<li><strong>Competing Priorities:</strong> Reschenthaler frequently highlights priorities such as border security, national defense, and local infrastructure, securing significant funding for these areas, which may compete with NASA science for appropriations. (Reschenthaler Statement, 2025-07; Reschenthaler Champions, 2024-03; Reschenthaler Votes, 2025-07)</li>
<li><strong>Skepticism of Climate/Earth Science Funding:</strong> His record, as noted by the League of Conservation Voters, includes actions "Repealing Actions on Climate and Environmental Justice," suggesting a potential disinclination to support NASA's Earth science activities. (League of Conservation Voters, Undated)</li>
<li><strong>Alignment with Executive Branch Budgetary Stances:</strong> Reschenthaler has expressed strong alignment with the "Trump's America First agenda" and stated that the agenda would be "whatever President Trump wants to set," which could lead to supporting executive branch proposals for NASA budget cuts, particularly those targeting science and climate research. (Reschenthaler Statement, 2025-03; Congressional Conversation, 2024-07; Senate Appropriators, 2025-07; The Daily Climate, 2025-04; Sen. Schiff, 2025-08)</li>
