<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation</li>
<li>Member, Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation: Aviation, Space, and Innovation Subcommittee</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Senator Fetterman's position on the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee and its Aviation, Space, and Innovation Subcommittee offers a direct avenue for advocating for NASA's Science Mission Directorate. Pennsylvania receives substantial NASA investments, including significant contracts for Astrobotic Technology in Pittsburgh for lunar missions and grants to The Pennsylvania State University for astrophysics and planetary science research, directly tying federal science funding to local economic and academic interests. His prior support for the CHIPS and Science Act and university research also signals a general receptiveness to federal investment in scientific innovation.</p>
<p>However, advocates should be aware that Senator Fetterman has consistently prioritized domestic issues such as healthcare, social programs, and infrastructure for Pennsylvania, which may compete with calls for increased discretionary science funding. His fiscal approach, including a willingness to support stopgap measures to avoid shutdowns, suggests that broad spending compromises could impact specific science budget lines. While his office may be open to understanding the local benefits of NASA science, securing a strong commitment for a significant budget increase, particularly in light of proposed cuts, will require a compelling case demonstrating direct alignment with his constituents' immediate needs and the state's economic interests.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching specific job creation figures or economic impact reports related to Astrobotic Technology Inc. and The Pennsylvania State University's NASA contracts, highlighting how these investments directly benefit Pennsylvanians and align with his focus on local economic vitality.</li>
<li>Explore how increased investment in NASA's space science activities aligns with the goals of the CHIPS and Science Act and his advocacy for university research funding, emphasizing Pennsylvania's role in cutting-edge scientific discovery.</li>
<li>Look into specific examples of how NASA science data or technologies have practical applications for improving infrastructure resilience, public health outcomes, or environmental monitoring within Pennsylvania, connecting space exploration to his constituents' everyday lives.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About John Fetterman</h2>
<ul>
<li>Earned degrees in finance (Albright), business (UConn), and public policy (Harvard).</li>
<li>Began career as a risk-management underwriter in the insurance industry.</li>
<li>Served with AmeriCorps, teaching students in Pittsburgh.</li>
<li>Elected Mayor of Braddock, PA (2006-2019), then Lieutenant Governor (2019-2023).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key Committee Assignment:</strong> Senator Fetterman's membership on the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and its Aviation, Space, and Innovation Subcommittee provides direct oversight and influence over NASA's budget and programs.</li>
<li><strong>Significant Local NASA Investment:</strong> Pennsylvania receives substantial NASA contracts and grants, including over $394 million to Astrobotic Technology Inc. in Pittsburgh for lunar missions and over $95 million to The Pennsylvania State University for astrophysics and planetary science research. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Support for Science and Innovation:</strong> Senator Fetterman strongly supported the CHIPS and Science Act, which provides billions for research and development, indicating a general commitment to federal investment in innovation.</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for University Research Funding:</strong> He co-sponsored the Organic Science and Research Investment Act, which aims to increase funding for research agencies and universities, including Penn State, demonstrating support for academic scientific endeavors.</li>
<li><strong>Demonstrated Bipartisan Collaboration:</strong> Senator Fetterman has shown a willingness to work across the aisle, including voting with Republicans on a Commerce Secretary nomination and stating a desire to "work together for a solution" and "secure wins for PA."</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competing Domestic Priorities:</strong> Senator Fetterman has consistently prioritized healthcare, social programs, and infrastructure for Pennsylvania, often voting against budget resolutions that would cut these benefits, indicating these areas may take precedence in funding discussions over increased investment in NASA science.</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal Approach and Anti-Shutdown Stance:</strong> His philosophical opposition to government shutdowns has led him to support stopgap funding measures, even when they did not include Democratic priorities, suggesting a willingness to compromise on broader spending that could impact discretionary science funding.</li>
<li><strong>Nuanced Climate Stance:</strong> While acknowledging climate change as an "existential threat," Senator Fetterman has shifted to an "all-of-the-above" energy approach and supports fracking, which has raised concerns among environmental advocates and could influence his support for certain Earth science initiatives if perceived as conflicting with Pennsylvania's economic interests.</li>
<li><strong>Selective Engagement with Legislative Duties:</strong> Senator Fetterman has previously described some Senate duties as "performative" and prioritized family time, which, despite his stated commitment to increased attendance, could indicate a selective engagement with legislative details that might affect deep advocacy for specific NASA science budget lines.</li>
