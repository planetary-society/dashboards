<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Senator McCormick's strong emphasis on fiscal conservatism and reining in government spending presents a significant challenge for advocating increased NASA space science funding, particularly given the proposed 47% cut for FY26. His focus on issues like inflation and national security, coupled with a lack of direct committee assignments related to space, suggests that NASA science may not be a top legislative priority. Furthermore, his calls for rigorous cost-benefit analysis and advocacy for traditional energy sources could lead to scrutiny of long-term scientific endeavors and Earth science programs.</p>
<p>Despite these hurdles, there are clear opportunities for engagement. Senator McCormick's background in mechanical engineering and his expressed support for university research indicate an appreciation for scientific and technical fields. Crucially, Pennsylvania benefits from substantial NASA contracts and grants, including significant investments in Astrobotic Technology for lunar missions and The Pennsylvania State University for astrophysics and fundamental science research, directly linking NASA science to local economic and academic interests. His broader commitment to innovation, technology leadership, and protecting American research from foreign adversaries also aligns with the goals of advancing U.S. space science capabilities. Advocates can leverage these local economic and strategic interests to make a compelling case for robust investment.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider highlighting the direct economic impact of NASA science contracts and grants in Pennsylvania, particularly with Astrobotic Technology in Pittsburgh and The Pennsylvania State University, connecting these investments to job creation and technological innovation within the state.</li>
<li>Explore how robust investment in NASA's space science activities is critical for maintaining U.S. technological leadership and national security, aligning with Senator McCormick's expressed concerns about foreign adversaries and protecting American innovation.</li>
<li>Look into specific research projects at Pennsylvania universities funded by NASA science grants, preparing to discuss how these projects foster STEM talent and contribute to cutting-edge discoveries, resonating with his engineering background and support for academic research.</li>
</ul>
