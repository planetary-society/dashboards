    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.
    All AI-generated claims, assessments, and recommendations should be independently verified.
    This is an experimental feature, and intended to provide guidance and inspiration for outreach strategies for your meeting. Feedback is welcome: casey.dreier@planetary.org.

<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Mace's strong fiscal conservatism and lack of direct space committee assignments suggest she may be predisposed to scrutinize or limit federal appropriations, including for NASA science. Her skepticism towards certain scientific narratives, particularly in Earth science, and a primary focus on other legislative priorities like cybersecurity and animal welfare, could present challenges for broad science advocacy.</p>
<p>However, the presence of a NASA science grant in her district, coupled with her leadership on UAP scientific inquiry and support for AI innovation, offers specific avenues for engagement. Advocates could highlight how increased NASA science investment, particularly in areas like advanced technology and UAP research, directly benefits local entities and aligns with her interest in responsible, effective federal research and U.S. technological leadership.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching the specific work Seres Engineering &amp; Services LLC performs with their NASA grant in Charleston, to articulate how NASA science funding directly benefits her constituents and local economy.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's foundational investments in astrophysics, planetary science, and advanced instrumentation are essential for any credible scientific investigation of phenomena like UAPs, demonstrating the interconnectedness of various science disciplines.</li>
<li>Look into examples of how NASA's science programs demonstrate fiscal responsibility and effective use of taxpayer dollars, perhaps by highlighting spin-off technologies or cost-efficient missions, to align with her focus on accountability in federal research.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Nancy Mace</h2>
<ul>
<li>First woman to graduate from The Citadel's Corps of Cadets program.</li>
<li>Earned a master's degree in journalism and mass communication.</li>
<li>Founded a public relations and consulting firm; co-owned a news website.</li>
<li>Led congressional hearings and expressed views on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs).</li>
<li>Authored legislation on cybersecurity, coastal protection, and animal research.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local NASA Science Investment:</strong> Representative Mace's district benefits from a NASA grant to Seres Engineering &amp; Services LLC in Charleston, SC, supporting a balanced science program aligned with national academies' guidance and congressional direction. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Leadership on UAP Scientific Inquiry:</strong> As Chairwoman of the House Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Information Technology, and Government Innovation, Representative Mace has led recent hearings on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs), where a witness from a NASA UAP study team advocated for increased NASA investment in UAP research to validate scientific seriousness. (House Oversight Committee, 2024-11; Newsweek, 2024-12)</li>
<li><strong>Support for AI Innovation:</strong> Representative Mace has expressed support for initiatives promoting U.S. dominance in artificial intelligence, recognizing its importance and advocating for the removal of barriers to innovation, which aligns with advanced technological development critical to space science. (Charleston Reporter, 2025-06)</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for Responsible Federal Research:</strong> Representative Mace has actively engaged in oversight of federally funded research, introducing legislation to prohibit federal funding for certain animal experiments and supporting alternative research methods, indicating a focus on accountability and effectiveness in government science investments. (CBS News, 2025-09; FASEB, 2025-02)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Representative Mace consistently advocates for reducing government spending and balancing the budget, including proposing a "penny plan" and criticizing "waste, fraud, and abuse," which indicates a predisposition to scrutinize or limit federal appropriations, including for NASA science.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Direct Space-Related Committee Assignment:</strong> Representative Mace does not hold any current committee assignments directly related to space or NASA oversight in the 119th Congress, suggesting that space policy may not be a primary legislative focus for her.</li>
<li><strong>Skepticism Towards Certain Scientific Narratives:</strong> Her past statements questioning the "settled" nature of climate science and her more recent assertion that "The Left Wants to Follow the Science When it's Convenient for Their Agenda" suggest a potential skepticism towards certain areas of NASA's Earth science mission.</li>
<li><strong>Competing Legislative Priorities:</strong> Her legislative record and public statements demonstrate a primary focus on issues such as cybersecurity, animal welfare (including criticism of "taxpayer-funded animal cruelty" in research), and gender-related policies, which may divert attention and resources from broader NASA science and exploration initiatives.</li>
<li><strong>UAP Focus vs. Broad Space Science:</strong> While she has actively engaged in discussions and hearings regarding Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs) and called for NASA to invest in UAP research, this specific interest is distinct from and does not necessarily translate to broad support for NASA's diverse science mission directorates like astrophysics or planetary science.</li>
