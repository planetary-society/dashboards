    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.

<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Sheri Biggs's strong fiscal conservatism and alignment with an "America First" agenda, which prioritizes domestic and national security issues, suggest she may be skeptical of calls for increased non-defense discretionary spending, including NASA's space science budget. Her focus on reducing government spending and other priorities like border security could make advocating for a significant increase challenging, especially given the proposed 47% cut to NASA science in FY2026.</p>
<p>However, her position on the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, and specifically the Subcommittee on Research and Technology, indicates direct oversight and engagement with federal R&amp;D. Crucially, her district benefits substantially from NASA science grants, with Clemson University receiving over $4.5 million for heliophysics and Earth science research in recent years. Highlighting these direct local investments and their contribution to scientific progress, which she has publicly supported as vital for U.S. leadership in space, could be key to demonstrating the tangible value of NASA's science mission to her constituents and the nation.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching specific projects at Clemson University funded by NASA science grants to highlight local job creation, student engagement, and the direct scientific contributions originating from her district.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA science investments yield tangible benefits beyond pure discovery, such as technological spin-offs that improve healthcare, contribute to national security, or drive economic growth, aligning with her focus on fiscal responsibility.</li>
<li>Look into how NASA science, particularly Earth science or heliophysics, contributes to areas like disaster preparedness, environmental health, or national security, which may resonate with her background as a nurse practitioner and military service.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Sheri Biggs</h2>
<ul>
<li>Holds a Doctor of Nursing Practice degree from Samford University.</li>
<li>Professional background includes serving as a nurse practitioner.</li>
<li>Served in the Mississippi Air National Guard, reaching lieutenant colonel.</li>
<li>Graduated from Carolina Bible College with a bachelor's degree.</li>
</ul>
