<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Appropriations</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Clyburn's position on the House Appropriations Committee offers a direct avenue for influencing NASA's science budget, and his district benefits from several NASA Science Mission Directorate grants across various disciplines. His past support for federal science and technology funding, such as the NIST investment at Claflin University, suggests a general receptiveness to scientific endeavors.</p>
<p>However, as a senior appropriator, he balances a wide range of federal spending priorities, and his emphasis on fiscal responsibility could temper enthusiasm for significant budget increases. While the local NASA science grants are beneficial, the total value over the last three fiscal years is relatively modest, which might limit the perceived direct economic impact compared to other district needs.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider identifying specific researchers or students in his district who have directly benefited from NASA science grants at the College of Charleston or University of South Carolina, to personalize the impact.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's scientific advancements, particularly in areas like Earth observation or materials science, contribute to broader federal science and technology goals that he has previously supported.</li>
<li>Look into how NASA's science mission activities, especially those with direct district benefits, demonstrate a strong return on federal investment, aligning with his focus on fiscal responsibility.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About James E. Clyburn</h2>
<ul>
<li>Graduated from South Carolina State University with a baccalaureate in history.</li>
<li>Taught at C.A. Brown High School in Charleston, South Carolina.</li>
<li>Served as South Carolina's Human Affairs Commissioner from 1971 to 1992.</li>
<li>Supported nuclear energy, including a 2010 contract to convert plutonium into nuclear fuel.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Direct District Investment in NASA Science:</strong> Multiple NASA Science Mission Directorate grants have been awarded to the College of Charleston and the University of South Carolina for research in planetary science, Earth science, and astrophysics, directly benefiting his constituents and local institutions. College of Charleston (Charleston, SC) and University of South Carolina (Columbia, SC) are recipients of these grants. [cite: USAspending, FY2022-FY2024]</li>
<li><strong>Appropriations Committee Membership:</strong> As a member of the House Committee on Appropriations, Representative Clyburn holds a direct role in determining federal funding levels for all agencies, including NASA's science programs, as evidenced by recent appropriations reports. The committee's funding decisions directly impact the grants received by institutions in his district.</li>
<li><strong>Support for Diverse Science Disciplines:</strong> Grants to district institutions cover a range of NASA Science Mission Directorate activities, including planetary science (Mars volcanoes), Earth science (ECOSTRESS LST), and astrophysics (interstellar dust, QPOs), indicating a broad benefit from NASA's scientific endeavors. College of Charleston and University of South Carolina are conducting this research. [cite: USAspending, FY2022-FY2024]</li>
<li><strong>Demonstrated Support for Federal Science and Technology Funding:</strong> Representative Clyburn celebrated and sponsored $17.4 million in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) funding for a Bioscience Research and Technology Center at Claflin University, an HBCU in his state, demonstrating a commitment to federal investment in science and technology infrastructure and research. Claflin University is in South Carolina.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competing Priorities Focus:</strong> As a senior member of the House Committee on Appropriations, Representative Clyburn is responsible for allocating federal funds across a wide array of government programs, including infrastructure, healthcare, and education, which may limit specific advocacy for increased NASA science funding over other critical areas.</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on Fiscal Responsibility:</strong> Representative Clyburn has publicly emphasized the need for fiscal responsibility in federal spending, which, while not specifically targeting NASA, could contribute to a cautious approach regarding significant increases in discretionary budgets, including NASA's science activities.</li>
