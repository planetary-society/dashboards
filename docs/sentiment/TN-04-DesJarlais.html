    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.
    All AI-generated claims, assessments, and recommendations should be independently verified.

<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative DesJarlais's scientific background and the significant NASA contracts held by Amentum Technology, Inc. in his district, particularly for "Engineering Services and Science Capability Augmentation," suggest a potential receptiveness to NASA's overall mission. His acknowledgment of constituents commuting to Huntsville for aerospace work and co-sponsorship of the "DOE and NASA Interagency Research Coordination Act" further indicate an understanding of NASA's economic and scientific value. The grant to Middle Tennessee State University for "radio jove 2.0" also directly links local academic activity to NASA science.</p>
<p>However, his strong fiscal conservatism and lack of direct committee assignments related to space policy present challenges for advocating for increased NASA science funding, especially given the proposed FY2026 cuts. His past opposition to certain climate initiatives might also make advocacy for NASA's Earth science programs more difficult. Advocates should emphasize the local economic benefits and the foundational scientific aspects of NASA's science mission, framing investments as critical for national competitiveness and technological advancement rather than solely as new spending.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider connecting NASA's scientific endeavors to Representative DesJarlais's background in chemistry, psychology, and medicine, emphasizing how fundamental scientific research often yields unexpected benefits for health and technology, aligning with his support for STEM education.</li>
<li>Explore highlighting the direct economic impact of NASA science investments in his district, specifically referencing the "Engineering Services and Science Capability Augmentation" contracts with Amentum Technology in Tullahoma and the "radio jove 2.0" grant at Middle Tennessee State University.</li>
<li>Look into discussing how increased investment in NASA's space science activities can further the goals of H.R.1368, the "DOE and NASA Interagency Research Coordination Act," which he co-sponsored, by fostering broader scientific collaboration and research into areas like dark matter.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Scott DesJarlais</h2>
<ul>
<li>Earned an undergraduate degree in Chemistry and Psychology from the University of South Dakota.</li>
<li>Received a Doctor of Medicine from the University of South Dakota School of Medicine.</li>
<li>Practiced medicine as a generalist in East Tennessee since 1993.</li>
<li>Served as a physician before entering Congress in 2011.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scientific Background:</strong> Representative DesJarlais holds undergraduate degrees in Chemistry and Psychology and a Doctor of Medicine, indicating a foundational appreciation for scientific inquiry.</li>
<li><strong>Local Aerospace and Science Contracts:</strong> His district includes Amentum Technology, Inc. in Tullahoma, TN, which holds significant NASA contracts for "Engineering Services and Science Capability Augmentation" and "Engineering and Science Services and Skills Augmentation," directly linking local economic activity to NASA science and exploration. Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro, TN, also received a NASA grant for "radio jove 2.0," a direct science activity. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Support for Aerospace Sector and NASA's Local Impact:</strong> He recently highlighted that nearly 7,000 constituents from his district commute to Huntsville, AL, for work at NASA and other aerospace contractors, demonstrating an understanding of NASA's economic importance to his region. (Congressman Scott DesJarlais, 2025-09)</li>
<li><strong>Co-sponsorship of NASA Interagency Research Bill:</strong> Representative DesJarlais is a co-sponsor of H.R.1368, the "DOE and NASA Interagency Research Coordination Act" in the 119th Congress, which aims to foster collaboration on research areas like dark matter. (Congress.gov, 2025-03)</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for STEM Education:</strong> His official website emphasizes increasing "Science, Math, Engineering and Technology instruction" to improve young lives and the economy, aligning with the long-term workforce needs of NASA science. (Congressman Scott DesJarlais, 2025)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of Direct Legislative Influence:</strong> Representative DesJarlais holds no current space-related committee assignments in the 119th Congress, limiting his direct legislative platform to champion NASA science and exploration.</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> He consistently advocates for fiscal discipline and reduced government spending, as evidenced by his high ratings from conservative organizations and support for legislation aimed at reducing mandatory spending, which could lead to skepticism about increasing NASA's budget.</li>
<li><strong>Opposition to Climate Science Initiatives:</strong> Representative DesJarlais has publicly opposed the "Green New Deal," characterizing it as a "socialist agenda" and advocating for free-market solutions to environmental issues, which may translate to opposition to funding for NASA's Earth science programs.</li>
<li><strong>Competing Legislative Priorities:</strong> His public record indicates a primary focus on issues such as immigration enforcement, gun rights, and healthcare, suggesting that increased NASA science funding may not be a top legislative priority.</li>
