    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.
    All AI-generated claims, assessments, and recommendations should be independently verified.

<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Cohen's past service on the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee and his stated commitment to federal science funding suggest a foundational understanding and general support for scientific endeavors. Local NASA science grants to the University of Memphis for astrophysics research, totaling over $590,000 in the last three years, directly align with NASA's Science Mission Directorate and provide a clear local benefit that can be highlighted. Furthermore, his recent announcements of NSF grants to local institutions reinforce a pattern of supporting federal investment in research and STEM education.</p>
<p>However, his current lack of a direct oversight role in space or science committees means NASA science funding may not be a top legislative priority. His public focus tends towards domestic issues like criminal justice and voting rights, and there's no recent public record of him specifically advocating for increased NASA science funding. While the local economic ties through FedEx contracts are notable, they are not directly tied to science mission funding. Advocates should emphasize the direct local impact of NASA science grants and connect the proposed FY2026 cuts to the potential loss of these valuable research opportunities in his district.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching the specific NASA-funded astrophysics projects at the University of Memphis to highlight local scientific contributions and the direct impact of federal science investment in the district.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's science mission aligns with Representative Cohen's stated commitment to federal science and STEM funding, potentially linking to local educational institutions or the economic benefits from NASA contracts in the district.</li>
<li>Look into Representative Cohen's prior engagement with space policy during his tenure on the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, and consider how increased NASA science investment could support his broader legislative priorities for the district.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Steve Cohen</h2>
<ul>
<li>Earned a B.A. from Vanderbilt (1971) and a J.D. from University of Memphis (1973).</li>
<li>Practiced law for decades and served as a Tennessee State Senator for 24 years.</li>
<li>Instrumental in creating a regional hospital and establishing the state lottery for scholarships.</li>
<li>Previously served on the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology (2019-2021).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Local NASA Science Investment:</strong> Representative Cohen's district benefits from NASA grants to the University of Memphis for astrophysics research, including studies on supermassive black holes and galaxy evolution, directly aligning with NASA's Science Mission Directorate objectives. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support for Federal Science and STEM Funding:</strong> Representative Cohen has recently announced National Science Foundation (NSF) grants to local institutions, including a $499,998 grant to the University of Memphis for international energy grid research (Congressman Steve Cohen, 2025-07-17) and grants for racial equity in STEM education (localmemphis.com, 2024-09-12), indicating a general posture of supporting federal investment in scientific research and education.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stated Commitment to Science and Technology:</strong> Representative Cohen's official congressional website states his continued commitment to encouraging progress in science and technology for the American people, and his support for federal funding for programs like the National Science Foundation. (Congressman Steve Cohen, n.d.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Past Congressional Engagement with Space Policy:</strong> Representative Cohen previously served on the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology from 2019-2021, demonstrating a direct historical engagement with space and science policy issues. (Biography, n.d.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Local Economic Ties to NASA:</strong> Businesses in Representative Cohen's district, such as Federal Express Corporation in Memphis, have received contracts from NASA for package and freight delivery services, indicating a local economic connection to the agency. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of Direct Oversight Role:</strong> Representative Cohen does not currently hold any committee assignments related to space or science in the 119th Congress, which may limit his direct engagement and influence on NASA's space science budget and policy.</li>
<li><strong>Competing Legislative Priorities:</strong> Representative Cohen's public statements and legislative focus frequently emphasize domestic issues such as criminal justice reform, voting rights, and infrastructure, potentially indicating these are higher legislative priorities than increasing NASA science funding.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Recent Public Advocacy for Space:</strong> No recent public statements or legislative actions specifically advocating for increased NASA science funding or specific space science programs have been identified in the last 24 months.</li>
</ul>
