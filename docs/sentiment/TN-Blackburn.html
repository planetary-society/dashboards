<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Senator Blackburn's consistent advocacy for federal spending cuts and skepticism regarding climate science present significant hurdles for increasing NASA's science budget, particularly Earth science. Her emphasis on national security space and other legislative priorities may also divert attention from advocating for pure science funding.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, her position on the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, coupled with general support for NASA's missions and the Artemis program, offers potential avenues for advocacy. Crucially, Tennessee benefits from substantial NASA contracts, including multi-billion dollar awards to Amentum Technology and significant grants to Vanderbilt University and the University of Tennessee for various science research, providing a strong local economic incentive to support NASA's overall budget, including its science portfolio.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching specific job numbers or economic contributions generated by NASA science activities and related support contracts at Amentum, Vanderbilt University, and the University of Tennessee, highlighting the direct benefits to Tennessee constituents.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's space science discoveries and research, particularly those supported by Tennessee institutions, contribute to the Artemis program's goals, foster technological innovation, or enhance national capabilities.</li>
<li>Look into specific examples of Tennessee-based researchers, students, or small businesses whose work on NASA science projects has led to significant breakthroughs or local economic growth, preparing to share these compelling stories.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Marsha Blackburn</h2>
<ul>
<li>Earned a Bachelor of Science in home economics from Mississippi State University.</li>
<li>Owner of Marketing Strategies, a promotion-event management firm.</li>
<li>Former member of the Smithsonian Libraries Advisory Board.</li>
<li>Chaired a House panel investigating ethical implications of biomedical research.</li>
<li>Introduced bipartisan legislation on app markets and online child safety.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>General Support for NASA's Missions:</strong> Senator Blackburn co-signed a letter expressing strong support for NASA's critical missions, including scientific discovery, and to ensure the agency has necessary resources. This indicates a general positive posture towards NASA's overall endeavors, which encompass science. (Blackburn.Senate.gov, 2024-03)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support for Artemis Program:</strong> Senator Blackburn applauded the successful launch of Artemis I, demonstrating support for lunar exploration, which includes significant planetary science objectives. This aligns with growth in exploration programs that often integrate science. (Blackburn.Senate.gov, 2022-08)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Key Committee Assignment:</strong> As a Member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, Senator Blackburn holds a direct oversight role for NASA, providing a platform to influence and potentially advocate for science funding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bipartisan Space Infrastructure Advocacy:</strong> Senator Blackburn co-sponsored bipartisan legislation to support space launch infrastructure, demonstrating a willingness to collaborate on foundational elements critical to all NASA missions, including science. This suggests potential for bipartisan support on broader space funding issues. (Blackburn.Senate.gov, 2023-07)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Significant Local NASA Investment:</strong> Tennessee receives substantial NASA contracts and grants, including multi-billion dollar contracts to Amentum Technology in Tullahoma for engineering and operations support, and grants to Vanderbilt University and the University of Tennessee for planetary science, astrophysics, and Earth science research. These local economic and scientific benefits provide a strong incentive to support NASA's budget, including science. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Senator Blackburn has consistently advocated for federal spending cuts, including introducing proposals for across-the-board rescissions in non-defense discretionary appropriations, which could impact NASA's science budget.</li>
<li><strong>Skepticism on Climate Science:</strong> Senator Blackburn has expressed skepticism regarding the scientific consensus on human-caused climate change and has supported efforts to cut funding for climate-related programs, indicating potential resistance to NASA's Earth science activities.</li>
<li><strong>Prioritization of National Security Space:</strong> Senator Blackburn has emphasized space initiatives with national security implications, such as reintroducing legislation to create a Space National Guard and promoting quantum technology for defense applications, which may prioritize military space over pure science.</li>
<li><strong>Competing Legislative Priorities:</strong> As Chairman of the Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Technology, and Data Privacy, Senator Blackburn dedicates significant legislative effort to issues like online child safety, which may divert focus from advocating for increased NASA science funding.</li>
