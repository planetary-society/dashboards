<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, Senate Committee on Appropriations</li>
<li>Member, Senate Committee on Appropriations: Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Senator Hagerty's position on the Senate Appropriations Committee and its Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee offers a direct avenue for influencing NASA's budget, including science. Furthermore, significant NASA science grants to Vanderbilt University and the University of Tennessee demonstrate a clear local interest in planetary science, Earth science, and astrophysics research. His general support for research and innovation, along with his vote for the overall CJS appropriations bill, suggests a baseline willingness to fund federal scientific endeavors.</p>
<p>However, advocates should anticipate challenges. Senator Hagerty's fiscal conservative stance and skepticism towards climate-related regulations could make increased funding for NASA's Earth science programs a difficult sell. While Tennessee benefits from substantial NASA contracts, these are largely for operational and engineering support, indicating a potential prioritization of economic impact and strategic space benefits over pure scientific research. Advocates should be prepared to emphasize the economic and strategic returns of NASA's science portfolio, connecting it to national competitiveness and technological advancement.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider highlighting the specific NASA science grants received by Vanderbilt University and the University of Tennessee, connecting these investments to local job creation, student opportunities, and Tennessee's role in cutting-edge research.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's science mission, including the data and technological advancements it produces, supports and enhances the engineering and operations work performed by major contractors like Amentum in Tullahoma, linking science investment to broader economic benefits in Tennessee.</li>
<li>Look into framing increased investment in NASA's space science as a strategic imperative for national competitiveness and innovation, aligning with Senator Hagerty's emphasis on ensuring research institutions can compete internationally and drive national advantage.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Bill Hagerty</h2>
<ul>
<li>Earned B.A. in economics/business and J.D. from Vanderbilt University.</li>
<li>Extensive career in private equity, co-founded Hagerty Peterson &amp; Company.</li>
<li>Served as U.S. Ambassador to Japan from 2017 to 2019.</li>
<li>Former Commissioner of Tennessee Economic and Community Development.</li>
<li>Worked as an economic advisor in the George H.W. Bush administration.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Appropriations Committee Membership:</strong> Senator Hagerty's role on the Senate Committee on Appropriations and its Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee provides direct influence over NASA's budget, including science activities. (U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations, 2025-01)</li>
<li><strong>Local NASA Science Grants:</strong> Vanderbilt University and the University of Tennessee in Senator Hagerty's home state have received significant NASA grants for planetary science, Earth science, and astrophysics research, demonstrating a direct local interest in NASA's Science Mission Directorate. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Support for Research and Innovation:</strong> Senator Hagerty has emphasized the importance of ensuring research institutions can compete internationally and that scientific research is a key driver of national strategic advantage, indicating a general appreciation for federally funded research. (Forbes, 2025-06)</li>
<li><strong>Bipartisan CJS Appropriations Vote:</strong> Senator Hagerty voted in favor of the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies appropriations bill in July 2025, which includes funding for NASA, reflecting a willingness to support the overall funding package that encompasses NASA science. (Forbes, 2025-07; YouTube, 2025-07)</li>
<li><strong>Tennessee's Space Industry Presence:</strong> Major NASA contractors like Amentum Technology, Inc. in Tullahoma, TN, hold significant contracts for engineering and operations support, some of which include science capability augmentation, linking NASA's broader mission to local economic interests. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Skepticism on Climate Science/Regulations:</strong> Senator Hagerty introduced legislation to exempt U.S. companies from European Union sustainability requirements, labeling them "ideologically motivated regulatory overreach," and opposed a bill prohibiting EPA emissions standards, indicating a potential skepticism toward climate-related government initiatives that could extend to NASA's Earth science programs.</li>
<li><strong>Prioritization of Economic and Strategic Space Benefits:</strong> His public statements emphasize the strategic importance of space activities, such as the U.S. Space Command relocation and the role of Arnold Air Force Base, and his background in economic development suggests a focus on the job creation and economic impact of NASA contracts in Tennessee, which are largely for operational and engineering support. [cite: 1, 9, 10, contracts]</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism and Spending Scrutiny:</strong> Senator Hagerty's past actions, such as voting against the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act due to expense and advocating for "clean" funding bills to avoid "unrelated agendas," suggest a general fiscal conservative stance that may lead to scrutiny of NASA's budget, particularly for programs not directly tied to immediate economic or strategic returns.</li>
<li><strong>Potential for Nuanced Funding Allocation within NASA:</strong> While the Senate committee-reported bill for FY2025 increased overall NASA funding, it proposed a slight decrease for the Exploration account and Safety, Security, and Mission Services, indicating a willingness to adjust funding allocations among NASA's various directorates and programs.</li>
