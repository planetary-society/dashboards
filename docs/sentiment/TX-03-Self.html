    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.

<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology</li>
<li>Member, House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology: Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Self's strong fiscal conservatism and explicit calls for federal spending reductions, particularly for Fiscal Year 2026, present a significant challenge to advocating for increased NASA space science funding. His emphasis on cutting "less needed programs" and addressing the national debt as an "existential threat" suggests a default inclination to limit budget growth, potentially scrutinizing any proposed increases for NASA's science activities.</p>
<p>Despite these fiscal priorities, Representative Self's position on the House Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee and his stated commitment to "scientific research and discovery" indicate a foundational appreciation for NASA's mission. Crucially, his district directly benefits from significant NASA-supported STEM education grants and a specific astrophysics research grant at East Texas A&amp;M, providing concrete, local examples of how space science investments foster innovation and contribute to the nation's scientific leadership. These local ties offer compelling evidence to demonstrate the tangible returns and strategic importance of continued investment in NASA's science portfolio.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching specific success stories or student testimonials from the Robotics Education and Competition Foundation or East Texas A&amp;M University to highlight the local impact of NASA science investments on STEM education and research within the district.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's foundational space science research contributes to broader technological innovation and national competitiveness, aligning with Representative Self's stated commitment to "cutting-edge technological innovation" and his engineering background.</li>
<li>Look into examples of how NASA space science investments have led to economic benefits, private sector growth, or dual-use technologies that also serve national security interests, to address Representative Self's fiscal conservatism and focus on "emerging threats" in outer space.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Keith Self</h2>
<ul>
<li>Earned a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering from the U.S. Military Academy (1975).</li>
<li>Served 24 years in the U.S. Army, including Special Forces and Army Rangers.</li>
<li>Retired from the U.S. Army as a lieutenant colonel after active duty service.</li>
<li>Served three terms as the Collin County Judge in Texas (2007-2018).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Committee Leadership:</strong> Representative Self serves on the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology and its Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee, directly engaging him in legislative and oversight activities for NASA's budget and programs.</li>
<li><strong>Local STEM Investment:</strong> His district benefits from NASA-supported grants totaling over $4.3 million to the Robotics Education and Competition Foundation and Vex Robotics in Greenville, TX, for STEM learning and robotics competitions, which directly supports the pipeline for future NASA scientists and engineers. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Direct Space Science Research:</strong> East Texas A&amp;M University in Commerce, TX, received a $357,000 NASA grant for research on neutron star matter, directly contributing to NASA's astrophysics objectives and the NICER mission. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Bipartisan Space Advocacy:</strong> Representative Self co-introduced a bipartisan resolution designating July 20, 2025, as "National Moon Landing Day," highlighting American leadership in space exploration, scientific research, and innovation, and encouraging education on the benefits of space exploration.</li>
<li><strong>Commitment to Scientific Discovery:</strong> Upon his assignment to the Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee, Representative Self stated his commitment to ensuring America dominates in "scientific research and discovery" and "cutting-edge technological innovation," indicating a broad appreciation for scientific advancement.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strong Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Representative Self has consistently advocated for significant federal spending reductions and expressed concerns about the national debt, indicating a general inclination to limit federal expenditures, which could constrain NASA's budget growth.</li>
<li><strong>Prioritization of Spending Cuts:</strong> He explicitly urged Republican leadership to prioritize legislation that includes spending reductions for Fiscal Year 2026, stating the national debt is an "existential threat" to the Republic.</li>
<li><strong>"Less Needed Programs" Stance:</strong> Representative Self has stated that if money is added to any program, it should be taken from "less needed programs," suggesting that NASA science activities could face scrutiny under this framework if not strongly justified as essential.</li>
<li><strong>Competing National Security Priorities:</strong> As Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Europe and having introduced legislation related to international security affairs, including "emerging threats" in outer space, Representative Self may prioritize national security aspects of space over civil space science funding.</li>
