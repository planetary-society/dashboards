<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Gooden's consistent focus on fiscal conservatism and reducing government spending, coupled with the complete absence of NASA Science Mission Directorate contracts or grants in his district, suggests he may be highly skeptical of calls for increased funding, particularly against a proposed 47% cut. His emphasis on competing priorities like border security and veterans' care, alongside past actions questioning certain environmental policies, further complicates advocacy for some NASA science initiatives, especially Earth science.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, there are potential avenues for engagement. His support for local scientific research and expressed desire for American technological leadership indicate an openness to strategic investments. Critically, the University of Texas at Dallas, located within his district, hosts a space science research center, providing a direct local connection to the value of NASA's scientific endeavors. Highlighting the local impact of such research and the broader national benefits of space science for American competitiveness could be key to finding common ground.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching specific space science projects or faculty at the University of Texas at Austin or the University of Texas at Dallas that align with NASA's science mission, highlighting how increased investment could benefit these local institutions and his alma mater.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's space science investments contribute to American technological leadership and economic competitiveness, framing increased funding as a strategic investment that yields broader national benefits, potentially connecting to job growth or innovation in Texas.</li>
<li>Look into how the methodologies or outcomes of NASA's space science research, such as advanced data analysis or instrumentation development, could parallel or support other scientific research initiatives Representative Gooden has championed, like the Memory Health Life Center.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Lance Gooden</h2>
<ul>
<li>Graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a B.A. in government (2001).</li>
<li>Earned a BBA in finance from the University of Texas at Austin (2004).</li>
<li>Served two non-consecutive terms as a Texas State Representative.</li>
<li>Previously worked as a legislative assistant in the Texas State House.</li>
<li>Has served as U.S. Representative for Texas's 5th district since 2019.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Support for Local Research:</strong> Representative Gooden supported Community Project Funding for the Memory Health Life Center in Wood County, which will focus on Alzheimer's and dementia research and treatment, indicating an openness to funding scientific research. Local connection: Wood County is within Texas's 5th congressional district.</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for American Technological Leadership:</strong> Representative Gooden expressed concerns about the U.S. leading in Artificial Intelligence development, stating a desire for American leadership in advanced technology, which could extend to space science. Local connection: None directly, but a general interest in national technological competitiveness. (Fox News, 2023-04-05)</li>
<li><strong>Regional Support for NASA Presence:</strong> As a Texas Republican, Representative Gooden is part of a delegation that has advocated for strengthening NASA's presence in Texas, such as the effort to move NASA headquarters to the Johnson Space Center. Local connection: While Johnson Space Center is not in TX-05, this reflects a broader pro-NASA sentiment in his home state. (InnovationMap, 2025-05-13)</li>
<li><strong>Local Space Science Research Institution:</strong> The University of Texas at Dallas, located within Dallas County (part of TX-05), hosts the William B. Hanson Center for Space Sciences, conducting research in space plasma physics and related fields. Local connection: The University of Texas at Dallas is located in Richardson, Dallas County, which is within the 5th congressional district. (University of Texas at Dallas, undated)</li>
<li><strong>Alma Mater's Space Science Programs:</strong> Representative Gooden is an alumnus of the University of Texas at Austin, which has a robust Astronomy department engaged in frontier research in cosmology, planetary science, and instrumentation. Local connection: The University of Texas at Austin is his alma mater. (University of Texas at Austin, undated)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Representative Gooden consistently advocates for reduced government spending, responsible budgets, and cutting wasteful spending, as evidenced by his statements on the national debt and his criticism of recent spending bills (Lance Gooden, N.D.; Fox Business Video, 2024-03-22).</li>
<li><strong>Competing Priorities:</strong> His public statements and supported legislation highlight significant focus on issues such as border security, veterans' care, and local infrastructure projects, which may compete with increased NASA science investment for federal resources (Lance Gooden, N.D.; Congressman Lance Gooden, N.D.).</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Direct NASA Economic Ties:</strong> No public records of significant NASA Science Mission Directorate contracts or grants were found for entities within Representative Gooden's district (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024).</li>
<li><strong>Skepticism towards certain environmental policies:</strong> Representative Gooden's record includes actions that undermine federal authority on LNG and attack oil and gas leasing reforms, indicating a potential ideological misalignment with certain aspects of NASA's Earth science activities (League of Conservation Voters, N.D.; Congressman Lance Gooden, N.D.).</li>
