<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Appropriations</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Ellzey's strong fiscal conservatism and emphasis on reducing government spending present a significant challenge to advocating for increased NASA space science funding, especially given the proposed 47% budget cut for FY2026. His legislative priorities heavily lean towards border security, national defense, and veterans' affairs, potentially overshadowing non-defense discretionary spending. Furthermore, his opposition to climate change initiatives suggests a likely reluctance to support NASA's Earth science activities.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, there are clear opportunities for engagement. Representative Ellzey recently secured substantial funding for the NASA balloon facility in Palestine, Texas, demonstrating direct support for a key scientific asset in his district. His position on the House Appropriations Committee provides a direct avenue for influence, and he has previously expressed an appreciation for NASA's inspirational mission and the value of scientific exploration. Local NASA contracts also provide tangible economic benefits that can be highlighted.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching the specific types of jobs and economic impact generated by NASA science contracts with RKR Technologies in Arlington and Cpi Satcom in Irving, highlighting how these investments directly benefit his constituents.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's deep space science missions, which he has championed as "inspiration and unification," align with the spirit of exploration and technological advancement often associated with military service and aviation.</li>
<li>Look into how the scientific discoveries and technological advancements from NASA's broader space science portfolio complement the critical research conducted at the Palestine Balloon Facility, demonstrating a cohesive and impactful return on federal investment.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Jake Ellzey</h2>

</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Support for NASA Balloon Facility Funding:</strong> Representative Ellzey secured $49.3 million in the FY2026 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill to maintain operations at the NASA balloon facility in Palestine, Texas, emphasizing its critical role for science, community, and American innovation. The facility conducts high-altitude scientific balloon missions. (CBS19, 2025-08)</li>
<li><strong>Appropriations Committee Influence:</strong> As a Member of the House Committee on Appropriations, Representative Ellzey holds a direct role in shaping federal spending, including the budget for NASA's science and exploration programs. (Authoritative Committee Data, 2025-09)</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for NASA's Inspirational Mission:</strong> During an April 2023 House Appropriations Committee hearing, Representative Ellzey delivered an impassioned speech highlighting NASA's mission of "inspiration and unification" and its role in deep space exploration, expressing anticipation for future lunar missions. (SpacePolicyOnline.com, 2023-04)</li>
<li><strong>Local Economic Impact from NASA Contracts:</strong> Companies within Representative Ellzey's district, RKR Technologies, LTD. (Arlington) and Cpi Satcom &amp; Antenna Technologies Inc. (Irving), received over $470,000 in NASA contracts for fabrication services and antenna procurement, demonstrating direct economic benefit from NASA's hardware development supporting science missions. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Support for Scientific Research and Innovation:</strong> Representative Ellzey praised Rice University's "leading-edge research" and its contributions to national defense and technology, stating that "The Arctic is a contested region, no less than the moon or Mars," indicating a broader appreciation for scientific and strategic exploration. (Rice University, 2025-04)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Representative Ellzey has consistently advocated for cutting wasteful government spending and restoring fiscal sanity, which could lead to scrutiny of federal discretionary spending, including NASA's budget. (Congressman Jake Ellzey Appointed to House Appropriations Committee, 2023-01; Jake Ellzey for Congress, Issues, undated)</li>
<li><strong>Competing Priorities:</strong> His stated legislative priorities heavily emphasize border security, economic growth, education, national security, and veterans' affairs, potentially diverting focus or resources from increased investment in NASA science activities. (Jake Ellzey for Congress, Issues, undated; Congressman Ellzey Highlights Historic Investment to Strengthen Rural Health Care, 2025-09)</li>
<li><strong>Opposition to Climate Change Funding:</strong> Representative Ellzey has supported legislation that reduces funding for climate change initiatives, which could indicate a reluctance to support NASA's Earth science activities related to climate research. (Congressman Ellzey's Statement on the 2025 National Defense Appropriations Act, 2024-06)</li>
<li><strong>Preference for Defense-Aligned Innovation:</strong> While supportive of innovation and technology, his public statements often link these to national defense and countering adversaries, suggesting a potential prioritization of space activities with direct national security benefits over purely scientific endeavors. (Longview News-Journal, 2025-04; Congressman Ellzey's Statement on the FY26 National Defense Authorization Act, 2025-09)</li>
<li><strong>Appropriations Committee Scrutiny:</strong> As a member of the House Committee on Appropriations and the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, he has emphasized rigorous oversight of federal spending to ensure a "lethal, nimble, and reliable military force," which may lead to a critical examination of non-defense discretionary spending, including NASA science. (Congressman Jake Ellzey Appointed to House Appropriations Committee, 2023-01; Congressman Ellzey Appointed to Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, 2024-03)</li>
