    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.
    All AI-generated claims, assessments, and recommendations should be independently verified.

<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Luttrell's lack of space-related committee assignments and the minimal direct NASA science economic ties in his district, totaling only $178K over three years for general equipment, suggest he may not prioritize increased NASA space science funding. His professional background in defense and energy, alongside his legislative focus on these areas, could present competing priorities for his attention, making the proposed 47% cut to NASA Science in FY26 a challenging issue to bring to the forefront.</p>
<p>However, his Master of Science in applied cognition neuroscience and co-chairmanship of the Congressional Neuroscience Caucus demonstrate a clear appreciation for scientific research and securing funding for advanced medical and technological initiatives. Advocates can leverage his interest in cutting-edge technology and scientific discovery, framing NASA space science as a critical investment in national innovation and competitiveness, similar to his support for neuroscience and AI.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching how NASA's space science activities, particularly in human health and astrobiology, align with Representative Luttrell's strong interest in neuroscience and traumatic brain injury research, potentially highlighting local academic or medical connections.</li>
<li>Explore specific examples of how NASA's space science missions leverage advanced technologies and artificial intelligence for data analysis, instrument development, or autonomous operations, linking to his past advisory role at the Department of Energy.</li>
<li>Look into whether local companies like Vprime Tech Inc., or other businesses and universities in the 8th district, contribute to NASA's broader scientific enterprise, even through general scientific instrumentation or research, to demonstrate local economic and intellectual ties.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Morgan Luttrell</h2>
<ul>
<li>Earned a Master of Science in applied cognition neuroscience.</li>
<li>Served 13 years as a U.S. Navy SEAL, medically retired.</li>
<li>Advised Secretary Perry at Energy Department on AI and technology.</li>
<li>Founded Trexxler Energy Solutions, an energy industry business.</li>
<li>Adjunct professor at Sam Houston State University.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scientific Educational Background:</strong> Representative Luttrell holds a Master of Science in applied cognition neuroscience, demonstrating a foundational appreciation for scientific research and inquiry. This connects to the University of Texas at Dallas, a research institution in Texas (Biography; Wikipedia, 2025-09-11).</li>
<li><strong>Support for Neuroscience and Medical Research:</strong> As co-chair of the bipartisan Congressional Neuroscience Caucus, he is passionate about research and advances in neuroscience, securing funding for psychedelic and traumatic brain injury (TBI) research in the FY25 Defense Appropriations Act and for innovative therapies for PTSD and TBI in the FY25 NDAA. This aligns with the Texas Medical Center and Rice University in Houston, which are active in brain science research (Baker Institute, 2024-03-28,; House.gov, 2024-06-28; House.gov, 2024-12-11).</li>
<li><strong>Interest in Advanced Technology and AI:</strong> He previously advised the Department of Energy on AI and technology, leading the creation of the Artificial Intelligence and Technologies Office (2017-2019), and has secured funding for hypersonic infrastructure and research in recent defense appropriations. This indicates an interest in cutting-edge technological development relevant to NASA's high-tech missions (Biography; Wikipedia, 2025-09-11; House.gov, 2024-06-28; House.gov, 2024-12-11).</li>
<li><strong>Local Scientific Instrumentation Industry:</strong> Companies in his broader Houston area, such as Vprime Tech Inc, have received federal contracts for scientific instruments like leak detectors and optical particle spectrometers, indicating a local ecosystem that supports scientific and technological endeavors. Houston is also home to NASA's Johnson Space Center (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024; Wikipedia,).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of Space-Related Committee Assignments:</strong> Representative Luttrell holds no current space-related committee assignments in the 119th Congress, which may limit his direct legislative influence or focus on NASA's space science activities. (Authoritative Committee Data, 2025-09)</li>
<li><strong>Limited Direct NASA Science Economic Ties:</strong> The NASA contracts identified in his district are for general equipment and and infrastructure, totaling approximately $178K, rather than direct investments in specific science mission directorate activities, suggesting a less direct economic incentive for advocating for increased NASA science funding. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Focus on Energy and Defense Priorities:</strong> Representative Luttrell's professional background includes serving as a U.S. Navy SEAL and founding an energy industry business, indicating potential legislative priorities in defense and energy sectors that may compete with or overshadow advocacy for NASA's space science budget. (Biography, 2025-09)</li>
