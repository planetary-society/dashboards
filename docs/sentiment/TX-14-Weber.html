<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Weber's role on the House Science Committee and his co-sponsorship of the NASA Reauthorization Act indicate a foundational engagement with NASA's mission, including its science components. His expressed support for Artemis and lunar exploration, coupled with a significant local contract for the VIPER planetary science mission, offers a clear opportunity to connect robust science funding to district interests and broader exploration goals. His general appreciation for basic science research also suggests a potential receptiveness to the value of scientific investment.</p>
<p>However, his consistent commitment to fiscal conservatism and emphasis on commercial space and human exploration present significant challenges to advocating for increased NASA science funding, especially in the face of proposed deep cuts. Advocates will need to clearly demonstrate how robust science funding, including for robotic missions, directly underpins human exploration, fosters commercial innovation, and delivers tangible benefits that align with his priorities, such as the scientific investigations supported by the local VIPER contract.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching the specific scientific contributions of Windhover Labs LLC's contract for the VIPER mission, highlighting how local businesses in his district directly support NASA's lunar science objectives and economic growth.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's broader science investments, particularly in areas like Earth science data for agriculture or lunar resource mapping, align with the directives of the NASA Reauthorization Act he co-sponsored and provide tangible benefits to Texas.</li>
<li>Look into specific examples of NASA science missions that demonstrate efficient use of taxpayer funds, leverage commercial partnerships, or directly contribute to human exploration goals, addressing his fiscal conservatism and focus on commercial space and human exploration.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Randy K. Sr. Weber</h2>
<ul>
<li>Earned a BS in public affairs from the University of Houstonâ€“Clear Lake.</li>
<li>Founded and owned Weber's Air &amp; Heat Air-Conditioning Company since 1981.</li>
<li>Served as a city councilman for Pearland, Texas, for six years.</li>
<li>Previously served in the Texas House of Representatives.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>House Science Committee Membership:</strong> Representative Weber serves as a Member of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, indicating direct engagement with NASA's oversight and authorization, including its science and exploration portfolios. (U.S. Representative Randy Weber, 2025-01)</li>
<li><strong>Support for Artemis and Lunar Exploration:</strong> He has expressed excitement for NASA's Artemis campaign and support for the Moon to Mars program, emphasizing the goal of reestablishing a lunar program and being the first nation on Mars. This aligns with NASA's planetary science and human exploration objectives. (GovInfo, 2025-02)</li>
<li><strong>Local NASA Contract Connection:</strong> A company in his district, Windhover Labs LLC in League City, TX, received a NASA contract for "Viper command and telemetry communications integration &amp; test," directly supporting NASA's lunar exploration efforts which include scientific investigations. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Co-sponsorship of NASA Reauthorization Act:</strong> Representative Weber co-sponsored H.R.8958, the NASA Reauthorization Act of 2024, which passed the House in September 2024. This bill reauthorizes NASA programs, including directives for lunar and Mars exploration, and mandates evaluation of greenhouse gas detection capabilities and distribution of Earth science data to agriculture. (Congress.gov, 2024-09)</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for Basic Science Research:</strong> As Chairman of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee's Energy Subcommittee, he has highlighted the importance of basic science research and his work on legislation like the Department of Energy Science for the Future Act, which reauthorized basic research programs, demonstrating a broader appreciation for scientific investment. (House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology - Republicans, 2025-02)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Representative Weber's voting record and public statements consistently reflect a commitment to fiscal conservatism and reducing government spending, which could lead to a preference for limiting overall federal appropriations, including NASA's science budget. (Office of the Clerk, U.S. House of Representatives, 2024-03; Randy Weber, 2024-07)</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on Commercial Space:</strong> Representative Weber has emphasized leveraging commercial capabilities and private sector innovation in space, which, while beneficial, could lead to a view that some government-funded science initiatives should be reduced in favor of commercial solutions. (House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, 2024-03; Randy Weber, 2023-11)</li>
<li><strong>Focus on Human Exploration:</strong> During committee hearings, Representative Weber's questions and statements often prioritize human spaceflight programs like Artemis, potentially leading to a focus on exploration over some robotic science missions in budget allocation discussions. (House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, 2024-03)</li>
