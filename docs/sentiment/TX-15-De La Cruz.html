<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative De La Cruz's fiscal conservatism and stated commitment to cutting federal spending present a significant challenge for advocating increased NASA science funding, particularly given her skepticism towards climate-related initiatives which could impact Earth Science programs. Her lack of direct committee assignments overseeing NASA also limits her immediate legislative influence on the agency's budget.</p>
<p>However, the substantial NASA science grants flowing to universities in her district for research in spaceflight microbiology, astrophysics, and planetary science offer a compelling local economic and academic argument. Highlighting these direct benefits and her general support for strengthening NASA's presence in Texas could make her receptive to advocacy for specific science programs that directly impact her constituents and local institutions.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider highlighting the direct economic and educational benefits of NASA science grants to Texas State University and The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, connecting these investments to local jobs and student opportunities within her district.</li>
<li>Explore framing increased NASA science investment, particularly in areas like astrophysics or spaceflight microbiology, as a strategic federal investment that fosters innovation and provides a strong return for taxpayers.</li>
<li>Look into sharing personal stories or local examples of how NASA science inspires constituents or contributes to Texas's leadership in space, building on her demonstrated support for strengthening NASA's presence in the state.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Monica De La Cruz</h2>
<ul>
<li>Graduated from University of Texas at San Antonio with a marketing degree.</li>
<li>Interned at Turner Entertainment; worked for Cartoon Network Latin America.</li>
<li>Prior to Congress, she was an insurance agent and business owner.</li>
<li>First Republican elected to represent Texas's 15th district since 1903.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Local NASA Science Investment:</strong> Representative De La Cruz's district directly benefits from substantial NASA Science Mission Directorate grants to local universities for research in areas such as spaceflight microbiology, astrophysics, and planetary science, indicating a vested local interest in maintaining or growing this federal investment. Texas State University (San Marcos, TX) and The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (Edinburg, TX) received grants totaling over $2 million for NASA science activities. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Advocacy for Texas's Role in Space:</strong> Representative De La Cruz co-signed a bipartisan letter in April 2025 urging the relocation of NASA Headquarters to the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, demonstrating a general supportive posture toward NASA's mission and its economic and research impact within the state. This action suggests an openness to strengthening NASA's presence and activities in Texas, which often includes scientific endeavors. (Senator Ted Cruz Press Release, 2025-04)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support for Federal Funding for Higher Education:</strong> Her congressional office provides resources for constituents seeking federal grants and emphasizes support for education, suggesting a general receptiveness to federal investment in academic institutions. This aligns with the universities in her district receiving NASA science grants, indicating a potential openness to continued federal funding for research and development. (Congresswoman Monica De La Cruz - House.gov, Undated)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of Direct Space/Science Committee Role:</strong> Representative De La Cruz does not hold any current assignments on committees directly overseeing NASA or science, such as the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee or the Appropriations Committee, which limits her direct legislative influence on NASA's budget and programs. (House.gov, 2025-09; Office of the Clerk, U.S. House of Representatives)</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism and Competing Priorities:</strong> Her public statements consistently advocate for cutting "wasteful Washington spending" and prioritizing issues such as border security, the economy, and agriculture, which may lead to skepticism regarding increased federal investment in NASA science activities. (Monica De La Cruz for Congress; Quiver Quantitative, 2025-09; House.gov, 2025-02)</li>
<li><strong>Opposition to Climate/Earth Science Funding:</strong> Representative De La Cruz has expressed skepticism about "burdensome environment projects imposed under the guise of climate change" and has opposed legislation related to climate action, indicating potential resistance to funding NASA's Earth Science Directorate. (Climate Power, 2024-09; Getty Images, 2025-06; League of Conservation Voters)</li>
