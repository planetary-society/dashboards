<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Sessions's consistent record of fiscal conservatism and opposition to broad spending bills presents a significant hurdle for advocating for increased NASA science funding, particularly in light of proposed budget cuts. His focus on reducing federal spending suggests he will scrutinize any proposals for additional appropriations.</p>
<p>However, there are clear avenues for engagement. His district benefits directly from NASA science through substantial contracts with Dell Federal Systems for critical data processing infrastructure and significant research grants to Baylor University and Texas A&amp;M for lunar, planetary, and biological sciences. Highlighting these local economic and research benefits, coupled with his historical support for NASA university programs and active participation in the appropriations process, may offer a pathway to garner his support for maintaining or strategically investing in NASA's science mission.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching specific job numbers or economic multiplier effects associated with the NASA science contracts held by Dell Federal Systems L.P. in Round Rock, emphasizing how these investments directly support district employment and technological innovation, including for natural disaster monitoring.</li>
<li>Explore how the NASA science grants received by Baylor University and Texas A&amp;M University System Health Science Center contribute to cutting-edge research, train a skilled workforce, and potentially lead to commercial applications that benefit the Texas economy, aligning with his support for local university programs.</li>
<li>Look into specific examples of how NASA science investments have historically yielded significant returns on investment through technological spin-offs, new industries, or cost savings in areas like weather forecasting or resource management, to address his concerns about federal spending by demonstrating long-term economic benefits.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Pete Sessions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Graduated from Southwestern University in 1978.</li>
<li>Worked 16 years at Southwestern Bell, becoming a district marketing manager.</li>
<li>Served as Vice President for Public Policy at the NCPA.</li>
<li>Recognized as a Distinguished Eagle Scout.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local University Research Funding:</strong> Representative Sessions has supported federal funding for Baylor University's Materials Science and Engineering Program, which enhances research impacting aerospace and other high-technology fields, and a Baylor planetary geophysicist is actively involved in shaping future NASA lunar missions. (Pete Sessions Press Release, 2024-08; Baylor University, 2024-05; Baylor University, 2025-07)</li>
<li><strong>District Economic Ties to NASA Science Infrastructure:</strong> Companies in his district, such as Dell Federal Systems L.P. in Round Rock, hold NASA contracts for compute servers that support the processing of NASA science products and near real-time data for natural disaster monitoring. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Active Engagement in Appropriations Process:</strong> Representative Sessions actively solicits programmatic and language requests for the annual appropriations process, which includes the Commerce, Justice, Science bill that funds NASA's science activities. (Pete Sessions Press Release, 2025-03)</li>
<li><strong>Historical Support for NASA Science and Exploration Programs:</strong> In the FY2022 appropriations cycle, Sessions secured provisions for NASA university-led aeronautics materials research and the NASA Space Grant program, demonstrating a pattern of supporting NASA's science and exploration initiatives. (Pete Sessions Press Release, 2022-03)</li>
<li><strong>Support for Local Space-Related Research Institutions:</strong> The Texas A&amp;M University System Health Science Center in his district receives NASA grants for biological and physical sciences research, and Sessions previously secured funding for a Space Research Hub at Texas A&amp;M. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024; Pete Sessions Press Release, 2022-07)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Representative Sessions has a consistent public record of advocating for reduced federal spending and fiscal responsibility, which may lead to scrutiny of proposals for increased NASA science funding.</li>
<li><strong>Opposition to Broad Spending Bills:</strong> Representative Sessions voted against the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2024, which included NASA funding, citing concerns over overall federal spending levels.</li>
<li><strong>Competing Legislative Priorities:</strong> Representative Sessions frequently emphasizes legislative priorities such as border security, economic development, and national defense, potentially diverting attention and resources from increased investment in space science.</li>
