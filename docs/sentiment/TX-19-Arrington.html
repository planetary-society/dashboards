<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Arrington, as Chairman of the House Budget Committee, is a vocal advocate for federal spending cuts, which presents a significant challenge for increasing NASA science funding. His past opposition to certain environmental regulations also suggests potential resistance to NASA's Earth science activities.</p>
<p>However, his professional background in research and commercialization, coupled with his district's substantial NASA science investments—including significant contracts for lunar exploration, planetary science, and asteroid discovery at Texas Tech and Hardin-Simmons—offer a compelling basis for engagement. These direct economic and innovation benefits to his constituents could make him receptive to arguments for maintaining or growing NASA's science portfolio, especially when framed around district impact and non-climate related research.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider identifying individuals or specific programs at Texas Tech University System or Hardin-Simmons University that have directly benefited from NASA science funding, allowing advocates to share local success stories that resonate with his past experience in research and commercialization.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's science investments, including those in his district, function as critical federal R&amp;D that drives innovation and economic growth, aligning with his support for domestic research and experimentation expenditures.</li>
<li>Look into specific examples of how NASA science investments, beyond direct contracts, generate broader economic benefits, technological advancements, or inspire STEM education, demonstrating a strong return on investment for federal dollars.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Jodey C. Arrington</h2>
<ul>
<li>Graduated from Texas Tech University with a Master of Public Administration.</li>
<li>Served as Vice Chancellor for Research and Commercialization at Texas Tech University System.</li>
<li>President of Scott Laboratories, a healthcare innovation holding company.</li>
<li>Worked in presidential personnel, specializing in energy, environment, and natural resources.</li>
<li>Held leadership roles at FDIC and in Gulf Coast rebuilding efforts.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Direct District Investment in NASA Science:</strong> Institutions within Representative Arrington's district have received substantial NASA contracts and grants for diverse science activities, including lunar exploration, planetary science, Earth science, astrophysics, and biological and physical sciences. Texas Tech University System in Lubbock, TX, received over $7.7 million for projects such as lunar instrumentation and Mars atmospheric studies, while Hardin-Simmons University in Abilene, TX, received $886K for asteroid discovery programs. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Experience in Research and Commercialization:</strong> Representative Arrington's previous role as Vice Chancellor for Research and Commercialization at the Texas Tech University System demonstrates a professional background in fostering scientific research and its application. He has publicly stated the importance of research for "advancing discovery, creating economic opportunity and improving our quality of life." (Texas Tech University System, 2011-08)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Advocacy for Domestic R&amp;D Tax Incentives:</strong> As the lead sponsor of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" (P.L. 119-21), Representative Arrington supported a provision allowing full expensing of domestic research and experimentation expenditures for tax purposes. This general support for R&amp;D could benefit research institutions in his district, including those engaged in NASA-funded science. (Wikipedia, 2025-07)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sponsorship of Bill with NASA Appropriations:</strong> The "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" (P.L. 119-21), sponsored by Representative Arrington, included specific appropriations for NASA, such as $700 million for a high-performance Mars telecommunications orbiter and $4.1 billion for the Space Launch System for Artemis missions. This directly supports NASA's planetary science and human exploration programs. (Congress.gov, 2025-08)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ideological Barriers to Government Spending:</strong> Representative Arrington, as Chairman of the House Budget Committee, is a vocal advocate for significant federal spending cuts and reducing the national debt, which could lead to skepticism regarding increased appropriations for federal agencies like NASA.</li>
<li><strong>Opposition to Climate Science Funding:</strong> He has actively worked to repeal "Biden-era Green New Deal Climate Regulations" and expressed concerns about a "radical environmental agenda," indicating potential resistance to funding NASA's Earth science activities related to climate change.</li>
<li><strong>Competing Priorities Focus (National Defense):</strong> Arrington consistently prioritizes national defense as the federal government's most important responsibility, potentially viewing other federal investments, including space science, as secondary in budget allocation.</li>
