<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Appropriations</li>
<li>Member, House Committee on Appropriations: Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Gonzales's fiscal conservatism and strong preference for commercial space solutions, advocating for the government to "get out of the way" rather than increasing direct funding, pose significant challenges to securing more investment in NASA science. This is compounded by the lack of direct NASA science contracts or grants in his district, suggesting limited local economic ties to these specific activities. His focus on national security and applied technology, alongside skepticism toward certain environmental regulations, may also make some science areas a harder sell.</p>
<p>However, his critical position on the House Appropriations Committee's CJS Subcommittee offers a direct and powerful avenue for influence. His general support for U.S. leadership in space and engagement with local aerospace research, combined with his STEM background, indicate a potential receptiveness to arguments that frame NASA science as essential for long-term national competitiveness, innovation, and maintaining America's preeminence in space. Advocates should emphasize how science underpins future commercial capabilities and national security.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider how specific NASA science initiatives contribute to U.S. technological superiority, national security, or create economic opportunities and high-tech jobs in Texas, aligning with his focus on applied technology and aerospace industry growth.</li>
<li>Explore examples of how NASA's foundational science research directly enables commercial space ventures and provides a strong return on taxpayer investment, addressing his fiscal conservatism and preference for commercial solutions.</li>
<li>Look into how NASA science investments support local institutions like Southwest Research Institute or create opportunities for veteran-owned small businesses in his district, making a personal connection to his background and local economic interests.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Tony Gonzales</h2>
<ul>
<li>Served 20 years in the U.S. Navy, retiring as a Master Chief Petty Officer.</li>
<li>A trained cryptologist in the Navy, deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan.</li>
<li>Holds a Bachelor of Science and is pursuing a PhD in international studies.</li>
<li>Worked as a Department of Defense fellow and political science professor.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Appropriations Committee Role:</strong> Representative Gonzales serves on the House Committee on Appropriations and its Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (CJS) Subcommittee, which directly oversees NASA's budget, providing a direct avenue to influence funding for science activities.</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for U.S. Space Leadership:</strong> He has publicly emphasized the importance of U.S. leadership in space exploration, stating, "The United States will always lead that way" in response to concerns about China's space ambitions.</li>
<li><strong>Support for Aerospace Industry Growth:</strong> Representative Gonzales co-signed a bipartisan letter advocating for expedited regulatory review of SpaceX's Starship project, highlighting the need for the federal government to support U.S. companies in maintaining leadership in space exploration and recognizing the economic impact of the space industry in South Texas.</li>
<li><strong>Engagement with Local Aerospace Research:</strong> He attended the grand opening of the Center for Accelerating Materials and Processes (CAMP) at Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) in San Antonio, a facility dedicated to research and development for high-speed aerospace engines.</li>
<li><strong>STEM/Technical Background:</strong> His background includes a Bachelor of Science degree and service as a trained cryptologist in the U.S. Navy, suggesting an appreciation for scientific and technical fields relevant to NASA's mission.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Representative Gonzales has consistently advocated for reining in wasteful government spending and scrutinizing federal programs, stating that "every organization should be put to the test" regarding taxpayer dollars, which could lead to pressure on NASA's discretionary budget.</li>
<li><strong>Preference for Commercial Space:</strong> Representative Gonzales views commercial space travel as the future, advocating for the government to "get out of the way" and allow industries like SpaceX and Blue Origin to thrive through streamlined processes rather than solely increasing direct government funding for space activities.</li>
<li><strong>Competing Priorities:</strong> Representative Gonzales's public record emphasizes significant competing priorities, including border security, military and veterans' affairs, and local infrastructure projects, which may divert his focus and advocacy from increased investment in NASA science.</li>
<li><strong>Skepticism towards certain environmental regulations:</strong> Through his role on the House Appropriations Committee, Representative Gonzales has worked to prevent funds from being used to create "burdensome regulations" for energy producers and has opposed amendments related to environmental standards, potentially indicating a cautious stance toward some NASA Earth science initiatives.</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on National Security and Applied Technology:</strong> Representative Gonzales, with a background in military cryptology, prioritizes technology as an "equalizer" for "big problems" and has focused on national security applications like drone detection, suggesting a preference for applied science and technology with direct defense or commercial benefits.</li>
