<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Appropriations</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Cuellar's receptiveness to increased NASA space science funding may be limited by the complete absence of direct NASA Science contracts or grants in his district, removing a key economic incentive. His strong focus on competing priorities like border security and healthcare, coupled with an emphasis on fiscal responsibility and a utilitarian view of science funding, suggests he will scrutinize proposals without clear, tangible benefits for his constituents. Furthermore, ongoing legal challenges could divert his attention from new legislative initiatives.</p>
<p>However, his vote for the FY2024 appropriations, which included NASA Science funding, and his success in securing local NASA-administered STEM funding, indicate a general openness to federal science investment and NASA's broader mission. Advocates should therefore emphasize how robust NASA Science funding contributes to national economic competitiveness, technological innovation, and STEM workforce development, aligning with his stated interests in education and national security. This approach could leverage his past support despite the challenges.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider discussing the positive impact of the NASA-administered STEM Connector Project at Texas A&amp;M International University, connecting how increased NASA science investment can further empower local students and workforce development in his district.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's space science activities contribute to national security, economic competitiveness, and technological innovation, framing investment as a strategic advantage that aligns with his background in defense and international trade.</li>
<li>Look into how robust federal investment in NASA science creates a pipeline of talent and innovation that can eventually lead to new research opportunities and economic benefits for districts like his, even without current direct contracts.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Henry Cuellar</h2>
<ul>
<li>Holds a B.S. in Foreign Service, an M.A. in International Trade, a J.D., and a Ph.D.</li>
<li>Practiced law, worked as a customs broker, and taught international commercial law.</li>
<li>Served in the Texas House of Representatives and as Texas Secretary of State.</li>
<li>Completing a Master's in Defense and Strategic Studies from the Naval War College.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Support for Federal Science Investment:</strong> Representative Cuellar voted in favor of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024 (H.R. 4366), which included $7.3 billion for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, demonstrating support for continued federal investment in science and research through a bipartisan compromise. (U.S. Congressman Henry Cuellar, Ph.D. Press Release, 2024-03-06; SpacePolicyOnline.com, 2024-03-08; AIP.ORG, 2024-04-02)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Direct Local NASA STEM Funding:</strong> In August 2023, Representative Cuellar announced he secured $963,000 in Congressionally directed funding, administered by NASA, for Texas A&amp;M International University (TAMIU) in Laredo, within his district, to establish a STEM Connector Project with Laredo College, fostering local STEM education and workforce development relevant to NASA's mission. (U.S. Congressman Henry Cuellar, Ph.D. Press Release, 2023-08-15; Texas A&amp;M International University, 2023-08-15)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of Direct District Economic Benefit:</strong> No relevant NASA Science Mission Directorate contracts or grants were found for Texas's 28th Congressional District. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Strong Focus on Competing District Priorities:</strong> Representative Cuellar consistently prioritizes border security, infrastructure, healthcare, education, and military/defense funding for his district, which may limit his focus on NASA science and exploration. (Laredo Morning Times, 2025-01; Laredo Morning Times, 2024-10; Texas Public Radio, 2024-03)</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on Fiscal Responsibility and Waste Reduction:</strong> As a member of the Blue Dog Coalition and author of legislation promoting government efficiency, Representative Cuellar advocates for "responsible spending" and eliminating "waste and duplication" in federal agencies. (U.S. Congressman Henry Cuellar, Ph.D., Responsible Spending; YouTube, 2025-03)</li>
<li><strong>Utilitarian View of Science Funding:</strong> While supporting the CHIPS and Science Act, Representative Cuellar's rationale focused on its benefits for American manufacturing, semiconductor production, and STEM workforce development for economic and national security, rather than pure scientific discovery. (U.S. Congressman Henry Cuellar, Ph.D., 2022-07)</li>
<li><strong>Ongoing Legal Challenges:</strong> Representative Cuellar's recent indictment on bribery and money laundering charges could divert his attention and political capital from other legislative issues, including space policy. (Associated Press, 2024-05)</li>
