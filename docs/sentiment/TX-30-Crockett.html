<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Crockett's primary legislative focus on social justice, criminal justice reform, and local infrastructure projects, coupled with her lack of direct space committee assignments, suggests that increased NASA space science funding may not be a top priority. Her expressed skepticism regarding large government contracts for private space companies and the district's limited direct economic ties to NASA's Science Mission Directorate further indicate potential caution towards significant new investments, especially given the proposed FY2026 budget cuts.</p>
<p>However, there are avenues for engagement. Her public support for STEM education, her vote for the National Science Foundation for the Future Act, and her emphasis on government transparency and interagency coordination, including NASA's scientific role, demonstrate a foundational appreciation for federal science initiatives. Her success in securing federal investment for her district also suggests she is receptive to funding that can be framed as beneficial to her constituents, offering a potential path for advocating for the broader benefits of NASA's space science programs.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching specific ways that increased NASA science funding could directly benefit the Columbia Scientific Balloon Facility, which receives energy from a Dallas-based company, or create new opportunities for local contractors like Airbus Helicopters in Grand Prairie, emphasizing local economic impact.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's science missions directly inspire and prepare students in her district for STEM careers, linking additional science investment to the educational and workforce development priorities she has publicly supported.</li>
<li>Look into how NASA's science activities represent a transparent and impactful federal investment, providing public benefits and advancing national knowledge, which aligns with her interest in effective government spending and interagency collaboration.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Jasmine Crockett</h2>
<ul>
<li>Graduated from Rhodes College with a Bachelor of Arts in business administration (2003).</li>
<li>Earned a Juris Doctor from the University of Houston Law Center (2006).</li>
<li>Served as a public defender for Bowie County, Texas.</li>
<li>Practiced law in a private firm, handling various legal cases.</li>
<li>Previously served in the Texas House of Representatives (2021-2023).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local NASA Science Infrastructure:</strong> Representative Crockett's district benefits from a contract with Txu Energy Retail Company LLC in Dallas, TX, which provides energy to the Columbia Scientific Balloon Facility, a NASA facility supporting scientific balloon missions. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Support for STEM Education:</strong> She has publicly emphasized the importance of STEM education, as demonstrated by her keynote address at #HouseOfCode 2024 in December 2024 and a visit to Lancaster STEM High School in August 2025 within her district. (YouTube, 2024-12; Lancaster ISD, 2025-08)</li>
<li><strong>Federal Science Funding Vote:</strong> As a member of the 117th Congress, she voted in favor of H.R. 2225, the National Science Foundation for the Future Act, which authorized significant federal funding for science and engineering research and development. (The Freedom Index, 2021-06)</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for Government Transparency and NASA Collaboration:</strong> During a September 2025 UAP hearing, Representative Crockett highlighted NASA's role in investigations and stressed the importance of government transparency and interagency coordination for a comprehensive understanding of phenomena. (YouTube, 2025-09; The Independent, 2025-09)</li>
<li><strong>Commitment to Federal Investment for District:</strong> Representative Crockett successfully secured over $10 million in Community Project Funding for Texas' 30th Congressional District in the FY2024 appropriations bills, indicating a general posture of seeking federal investment for local benefit. (Representative Crockett, 2024-03)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competing Priorities Focus:</strong> Representative Crockett's public record indicates a primary focus on issues such as voting rights, reproductive justice, criminal justice reform, and local community infrastructure projects, which may divert attention and advocacy from increased investment in NASA's space science activities.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Direct Space-Related Committee Assignment:</strong> Representative Crockett does not currently serve on any space-related committees in the 119th Congress, limiting her direct platform and dedicated engagement on NASA's space science and exploration programs.</li>
<li><strong>Skepticism Towards Commercial Space Funding:</strong> Representative Crockett has voiced criticism regarding substantial government contracts awarded to private space companies like SpaceX, particularly when contrasted with broader calls for federal spending reductions, potentially indicating caution towards increased commercial partnerships in NASA's exploration efforts.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Direct NASA Science Economic Ties in District:</strong> The provided contract data for TX-30 shows limited direct economic ties to NASA's Science Mission Directorate or exploration programs, beyond a contract for energy supply to a scientific balloon facility, which may reduce local impetus for advocating increased science investment.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on Regulatory Framework over Science Investment:</strong> While Representative Crockett introduced legislation (H.R. 5174) to update the legal framework for aeronautics and space programs, its emphasis on technical amendments and reorganization suggests a focus on administrative and regulatory aspects rather than a direct push for increased funding or expansion of specific NASA science activities.</li>
