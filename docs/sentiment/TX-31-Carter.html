<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Appropriations</li>
<li>Member, House Committee on Appropriations: Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Carter's position on the House Appropriations Committee and its Commerce, Justice, Science Subcommittee provides him direct influence over NASA's budget, including science activities. His committee recently rejected proposed cuts to NASA's overall budget and specifically provided a lifeline for the Mars Sample Return program, indicating a willingness to protect key science initiatives. Additionally, Firefly Aerospace, a significant employer in his district, holds substantial NASA contracts, including those categorized under NASA Science, which directly benefits the local economy.</p>
<p>However, Representative Carter's consistent emphasis on fiscal responsibility and scrutinizing program costs may make him cautious about significantly increasing discretionary spending for NASA science activities beyond current levels. While his district benefits from exploration and commercial space contracts, advocating for broader Science Mission Directorate funding will need to clearly articulate the economic benefits or strategic importance to his constituents. Therefore, while he may be receptive to maintaining or protecting specific science programs, advocating for substantial new investments across the board will require a compelling case.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider exploring how specific NASA science missions or data utilization directly benefit Firefly Aerospace's current and future projects, emphasizing the economic and job creation impact within his district.</li>
<li>Look into examples of NASA science programs that demonstrate strong return on investment, cost-effective management, or leverage public-private partnerships, aligning with his stated focus on fiscal responsibility and program oversight.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's Earth science or other research areas provide data and insights relevant to Texas's agriculture, water resources, or other state-specific interests, potentially connecting to his past role with the Texas House Agriculture Committee or local university research.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About John R. Carter</h2>
<ul>
<li>Graduated from Texas Tech University with a history degree (1964).</li>
<li>Earned a Juris Doctor from the University of Texas School of Law (1969).</li>
<li>Served as first general counsel for the Texas House Agriculture Committee.</li>
<li>Practiced private law and served as a district court judge for 20 years.</li>
<li>Represented districts including Fort Hood and Texas A&amp;M University.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key Appropriations Role:</strong> As a member of the House Committee on Appropriations and its Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee, Representative Carter holds a direct position to influence NASA's budget, including funding for science and exploration programs. This role allows him to advocate for programs that benefit local contractors. (House Committee on Appropriations, Current)</li>
<li><strong>Local Economic Interest in NASA Programs:</strong> Firefly Aerospace Inc., located in his district, holds multiple significant NASA contracts for Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) and Venture-Class Acquisition of Dedicated and Rideshare (VADR), directly supporting NASA's exploration and science objectives. Firefly Aerospace Inc. (Cedar Park, TX) is a major employer and economic driver in his district, benefiting from NASA investment. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Opposition to Overall NASA Funding Reductions:</strong> The House Appropriations Committee, of which Representative Carter is a member, approved an FY2026 Commerce, Justice, Science bill that rejected the administration's proposed cuts to NASA's overall budget, maintaining funding at roughly FY2025 levels. Maintaining NASA's budget helps ensure continued opportunities for local contractors and research institutions.</li>
<li><strong>Specific Program Advocacy within Appropriations:</strong> The House Appropriations Committee's FY2026 Commerce, Justice, Science bill, approved by the committee of which Representative Carter is a member, included a $300 million lifeline for the Mars Sample Return program, which the administration had proposed to terminate. This demonstrates support for a major NASA science mission.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Representative Carter has consistently emphasized fiscal responsibility and the need to reduce federal spending, which may limit his openness to significant increases in discretionary spending for NASA's science activities. (Office of Rep. John Carter, 2024-05)</li>
<li><strong>Focus on Program Oversight and Cost Control:</strong> As a member of the House Committee on Appropriations and the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee, Representative Carter has demonstrated a focus on scrutinizing the costs and management of NASA programs, which could lead to a cautious approach to funding new or expanding existing science missions. (House Committee on Appropriations, 2024-04)</li>
<li><strong>Prioritization of Exploration/Commercial Space:</strong> While his district benefits from substantial NASA contracts for commercial lunar payload services and launch capabilities, these economic ties primarily align with exploration and commercial space development, potentially leading to a prioritization of these areas over other Science Mission Directorate activities if budget trade-offs are required. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
