<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Chair, House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Babin, as Chair of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee and representing the district home to Johnson Space Center, is a critical voice on NASA's budget. While he has strongly advocated for overall NASA investment, particularly for human exploration and commercial space, his emphasis on national security, competition with China, and leveraging the private sector may lead him to prioritize missions with direct strategic or economic ties over purely scientific endeavors, especially Earth science. His district does benefit from significant NASA science contracts, including biosciences and astrobiology, which could be a point of connection.</p>
<p>Advocates should acknowledge his strong support for NASA's broader mission and the economic benefits to his district, while carefully framing the importance of science funding within the context of U.S. leadership and innovation, rather than solely focusing on climate-related research. Highlighting how science underpins future human exploration and commercial opportunities, and emphasizing the local impact of science-related contracts, may resonate more effectively given his stated priorities and fiscal scrutiny.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider highlighting specific NASA science investments in his district, such as the University of Houston's space materials and microbiome research, and how these directly support local jobs, economic growth, and scientific R&amp;D, aligning with his support for the R&amp;D tax credit.</li>
<li>Explore how increased investment in NASA's space science activities, including foundational research, directly underpins human exploration, commercial space development, and U.S. national security interests, addressing his key priorities.</li>
<li>Look into how his background in biology and dentistry, combined with his leadership on the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, positions him uniquely to champion the foundational scientific research necessary for maintaining U.S. leadership in space.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Brian Babin</h2>
<ul>
<li>Graduated from Lamar University with a B.S. in biology.</li>
<li>Earned a Doctor of Dental Surgery (D.D.S.) from the University of Texas Dental Branch.</li>
<li>Served as an officer in the United States Air Force from 1975 to 1979.</li>
<li>Practiced as a general dentist since 1979; served on the Texas State Board of Dental Examiners.</li>
<li>Demonstrated interest in NASA's space exploration programs and budget during a 2015 hearing.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Committee Chairmanship:</strong> Representative Babin, as Chair of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, holds a key position to influence NASA's budget and policy, including science programs, and has stated that "falling behind in any of these critical arenas is not an option." His district is home to NASA's Johnson Space Center.</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for NASA Investment:</strong> He co-led a letter in August 2025 urging swift implementation of nearly $10 billion in NASA investment from the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), which included $300 million for Johnson Space Center, emphasizing its role in advancing human exploration and maintaining U.S. leadership.</li>
<li><strong>Local Economic Ties:</strong> His district benefits from significant NASA contracts and grants in Houston, TX, supporting consolidated space operations, science engineering, ISS biosciences, astrobiology, and space materials research. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Support for Scientific R&amp;D:</strong> He applauded the restoration of the R&amp;D tax credit for domestic research in the One Big Beautiful Bill, stating it would "strengthen U.S. competitiveness and help fuel private-sector investment in innovation." The University of Houston System in his district received a grant for space materials and microbiome research. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Bipartisan Collaboration:</strong> He works with Ranking Member Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) on committee priorities, including a new NASA authorization bill, and believes Congress has the bipartisan capacity to sustain U.S. space leadership.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prioritization of Human Exploration and Commercial Space:</strong> Representative Babin's public statements and the significant NASA contracts in his district indicate a strong emphasis on human spaceflight to the Moon and Mars, and fostering a vibrant commercial space sector, which may lead to less focus on purely scientific endeavors not directly tied to these goals. (National Security Initiatives, 2025-02; POLITICO Pro, 2024-11; USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Skepticism towards large-scale climate-related government spending:</strong> As Chairman of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, Representative Babin has initiated probes into significant climate funds, raising concerns about transparency and due diligence, which could extend to NASA's Earth science budget. (House Committee on Science, Space, &amp; Tech, 2025-06)</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on National Security and Competition with China:</strong> Representative Babin frequently frames space efforts, particularly returning to the Moon, as a "race" against China and emphasizes maintaining U.S. leadership against adversaries, potentially prioritizing missions with direct geopolitical or defense implications over broader scientific research. (National Security Initiatives, 2025-02; American Institute of Physics, 2024-12)</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for leveraging the private sector:</strong> Representative Babin consistently advocates for reducing regulatory barriers for the commercial space industry and for federal science agencies to rely more heavily on the private sector, which could shift the approach to how NASA conducts science. (National Security Initiatives, 2025-02; American Institute of Physics, 2024-12)</li>
<li><strong>General fiscal scrutiny and efficiency focus:</strong> Representative Babin's committee actions demonstrate a focus on accountability, transparency, and efficient use of taxpayer funds, which could lead to close examination of NASA science budgets and program costs. (House Committee on Science, Space, &amp; Tech, 2025-05)</li>
