<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Senator Cornyn's consistent advocacy for fiscal conservatism and his skepticism regarding climate science present significant challenges to securing increased funding for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, particularly for Earth science activities. His legislative efforts and public statements predominantly prioritize human spaceflight and the modernization of infrastructure at Johnson Space Center, suggesting a potential preference for these areas over other science programs if budget constraints arise, especially in light of a proposed 47% cut to NASA science.</p>
<p>However, there is guarded optimism for specific science initiatives. Texas benefits substantially from NASA Science contracts and grants, totaling $1.9 billion over the last three fiscal years, with significant awards to institutions like Southwest Research Institute for planetary science and heliophysics. The MARS Act, which Senator Cornyn introduced, includes funding for astromaterials curation facilities at JSC, directly benefiting planetary science. Leveraging these strong local economic and scientific ties, particularly for planetary science and heliophysics programs, could provide a more receptive pathway for advocacy.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider exploring how increased investment in NASA's planetary science activities directly supports the goals of human spaceflight to the Moon and Mars, leveraging the Senator's focus on Johnson Space Center's infrastructure and the Astromaterials Curation facility.</li>
<li>Look into specific NASA science projects and their economic impact at Texas institutions like Southwest Research Institute and William Marsh Rice University, demonstrating how these investments align with the Senator's support for enhancing NASA research partnerships through the SPREES Act.</li>
<li>Explore how robust investment in NASA's space science activities drives technological innovation and maintains U.S. leadership in space, aligning with the Senator's stated interest in scientific advancement and national competitiveness as seen in the LAUNCH Act.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About John Cornyn</h2>
<ul>
<li>Graduated from Trinity University, St. Mary's University School of Law, and University of Virginia School of Law.</li>
<li>Served as a district judge, Texas Supreme Court justice, and Texas Attorney General.</li>
<li>As Texas Attorney General, established the Texas Internet Bureau to combat cybercrime.</li>
<li>Opposed federal funding for embryonic stem cell research, advocating for adult and cord blood alternatives (2007).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investment in JSC Infrastructure:</strong> Senator Cornyn introduced the "Mission to Modernize Astronautic Resources for Space (MARS) Act" to allocate $1 billion for upgrading NASA's Johnson Space Center (JSC) infrastructure, which is critical for human missions to the Moon and Mars and includes repairs to the Astromaterials Curation and Research facility for samples from these bodies. This directly benefits planetary science and exploration programs. (AI News, 2025-05)</li>
<li><strong>Support for Space Shuttle Legacy:</strong> Senator Cornyn championed efforts to relocate a retired NASA space shuttle to Space Center Houston, emphasizing Houston's historical role in human space exploration and public engagement with NASA's achievements. (Houston Republic, 2025-07)</li>
<li><strong>Modernizing Spaceport Infrastructure:</strong> Senator Cornyn co-introduced the "Spaceport Project Opportunities for Resilient Transportation (SPACEPORT) Act" to modernize the FAA's Space Transportation Infrastructure Matching (STIM) grant program, which would benefit Texas spaceports like Houston Spaceport and Midland International Air &amp; Space Port, supporting overall launch capabilities for civil and commercial space activities. (Senator John Cornyn Press Release, Undated)</li>
<li><strong>Streamlining Commercial Space Regulations:</strong> Senator Cornyn co-introduced the "Licensing Aerospace Units to New Commercial Heights (LAUNCH) Act" to streamline the application process for commercial space launches and satellite licensing, aiming to drive scientific advancement and maintain U.S. competitiveness in space. (Senator John Cornyn Press Release, 2025-06)</li>
<li><strong>Enhancing NASA Research Partnerships:</strong> Senator Cornyn co-introduced the "NASA Streamlining Partnerships for Research and Education for Engineering and Science (SPREES) Act" to enable NASA to partner more easily with other federal agencies for scientific and engineering research and education, directly supporting the research base at institutions like Southwest Research Institute and William Marsh Rice University in Texas. (Senator John Cornyn Press Release, Undated)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Senator Cornyn has consistently advocated for cutting federal spending and mandatory programs to address the national debt, and prioritized border security and tax cuts in recent budget negotiations, which could limit overall federal investment, including for NASA science.</li>
<li><strong>Skepticism on Climate Science:</strong> Senator Cornyn stated in 2020 that climate scientists' models do not use the "scientific method" and has a history of voting against environmental regulations, which may indicate a limiting posture toward NASA's Earth science activities.</li>
<li><strong>Prioritization of Human Exploration:</strong> While strongly supportive of NASA, Senator Cornyn's recent legislative efforts and public statements predominantly focus on human spaceflight missions to the Moon and Mars and the modernization of Johnson Space Center, potentially indicating a prioritization over other Science Mission Directorate activities if budget constraints arise.</li>
