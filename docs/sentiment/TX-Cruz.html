<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Chairman, Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation</li>
<li>Ex Officio, Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation: Aviation, Space, and Innovation Subcommittee</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Senator Ted Cruz's consistent skepticism regarding NASA's Earth science activities and his strong prioritization of human spaceflight for national security present significant challenges for advocating increased NASA science funding, especially given the proposed FY26 cuts. His emphasis on "core mission" activities may lead him to deprioritize certain scientific endeavors.</p>
<p>However, his position as Chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee provides a direct opportunity for engagement. Texas institutions, particularly Southwest Research Institute and William Marsh Rice University, receive substantial NASA science grants for planetary science, heliophysics, and astrobiology, demonstrating a clear local economic and scientific benefit. Highlighting these specific, non-Earth science related contributions and their impact on Texas's innovation and workforce could offer a pathway for a guardedly optimistic appeal for sustained investment in these areas.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching specific NASA science projects at Texas institutions like Southwest Research Institute or William Marsh Rice University, highlighting how these investments create jobs, foster STEM talent, and contribute to the state's economy.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's space science activities, particularly in areas like planetary science or heliophysics, serve as a "force multiplier" for innovation and national security, aligning with his stated interests and his family's STEM background.</li>
<li>Look into how specific NASA science investments, especially in planetary science and astrobiology, directly support and enhance human exploration initiatives like Artemis by providing critical data, technology, and understanding for future missions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Ted Cruz</h2>
<ul>
<li>Graduated Princeton University and Harvard Law School.</li>
<li>Served as Texas Solicitor General, arguing nine times before the Supreme Court.</li>
<li>Parents were "mathematicians/computer programmers" in the oil industry.</li>
<li>Worked as a domestic policy advisor in the George W. Bush administration.</li>
<li>Received campaign contributions from oil, gas, and coal interests.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Chairmanship of Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee:</strong> Senator Cruz's role as Chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation provides direct oversight of NASA's budget and programs, including science and exploration, offering a significant platform for advocating for or influencing investment. (Politico Pro, 2025-07)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support for Texas-based NASA infrastructure:</strong> Senator Cruz has actively supported legislation to allocate $85 million to move the Space Shuttle Discovery to Space Center Houston, demonstrating a commitment to enhancing Texas's role in preserving and showcasing NASA's historical assets and public engagement. This directly benefits Space Center Houston, the visitor center for NASA's Johnson Space Center. (Politico Pro, 2025-07)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Significant NASA science grants to Texas institutions:</strong> Texas institutions, including Southwest Research Institute and William Marsh Rice University, receive substantial NASA grants for science activities such as heliophysics, planetary science, and astrobiology research, indicating a strong local economic and scientific interest in continued NASA science investment. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Facilitation of discussions on NASA's scientific impact:</strong> As Chairman, Senator Cruz has convened committee sessions where the positive impact of NASA's science, including its role as a "force multiplier for science" in understanding the solar system and driving innovation, is discussed, suggesting an openness to acknowledging its broader value. (Leonard David's INSIDE OUTER SPACE, Undated but recent context)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Opposition to NASA Earth Science:</strong> Senator Cruz has consistently criticized NASA's Earth science activities, arguing they are not part of the agency's "core mission" and are "political distractions".</li>
<li><strong>Skepticism of Climate Science:</strong> He has expressed skepticism regarding the scientific consensus on climate change and has recently challenged NASA's educational materials on climate as "alarmist" and "fueling youth climate anxiety".</li>
<li><strong>Prioritization of Human Exploration:</strong> As Chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, Senator Cruz strongly advocates for human spaceflight programs like Artemis and Moon to Mars, often framing them as critical for national security and competition with China, potentially leading to deprioritization of science if budget constraints arise.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on National Security and Economic Competitiveness:</strong> His legislative efforts and public statements emphasize space as a "strategic frontier" for national security and economic growth, which may lead to a preference for programs directly supporting these goals over pure science endeavors.</li>
