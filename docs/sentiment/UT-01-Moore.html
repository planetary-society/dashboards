    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.

<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Moore's consistent advocacy for fiscal responsibility and his lack of direct committee assignments overseeing NASA suggest a cautious approach to increasing overall space science funding. His emphasis on programs with clear national security and economic returns might lead to skepticism regarding broad budget increases, especially given the proposed 47% cut in FY26.</p>
<p>However, the significant NASA science contracts and grants flowing into his district, particularly to Utah State University and the University of Utah, offer a strong local argument for continued investment. His support for the University of Utah's Research Park, specific scientific equipment, and STEM workforce development indicates an appreciation for the scientific infrastructure and talent that NASA science fosters. Highlighting the direct impact of proposed cuts on these local programs could make him receptive to protecting and strategically investing in the district's space science endeavors.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider exploring how specific NASA science projects at Utah State University and the University of Utah directly contribute to the district's economy, STEM workforce development, and national security, aligning with Representative Moore's stated priorities.</li>
<li>Look into how NASA's science investments, particularly those benefiting Utah's 1st district, demonstrate a strong return on investment through technological innovation, job creation, and advancements that serve broader national interests, addressing his fiscal conservatism.</li>
<li>Explore personal stories from constituents in the 1st district who have directly benefited from or are involved in NASA-funded science research, highlighting the human impact and local connections that resonate with his community-focused background.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Blake D. Moore</h2>
<ul>
<li>Born and raised in Ogden, Utah; an Eagle Scout.</li>
<li>Earned a B.A. in behavioral science and business from University of Utah.</li>
<li>Holds a master's in public policy and administration from Northwestern University.</li>
<li>Served as a U.S. Foreign Service officer and business consultant.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local NASA Science Contracts:</strong> Representative Moore's district benefits from significant NASA contracts and grants to Utah State University and the University of Utah for heliophysics, planetary science, Earth science, and biological/physical sciences, demonstrating direct local economic and scientific ties to NASA's Science Mission Directorate. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for Research Park:</strong> Representative Moore recently led House legislation to protect the University of Utah's Research Park, highlighting its importance for "innovation, research, and development" and the need to support its "future needs," which underpins broader scientific endeavors. (Public now, 2025-04)</li>
<li><strong>Community Project Funding for Scientific Equipment:</strong> Representative Moore requested FY2025 Community Project Funding for the University of Utah to acquire an "electron beam lithography system," a key instrument for nanometer-scale device fabrication, directly supporting advanced scientific research capabilities. (U.S. Congressman Blake Moore, FY2025)</li>
<li><strong>Support for STEM Workforce Development:</strong> Representative Moore's FY2026 Community Project Funding requests include support for the Utah Network for Integrated Computing and Semiconductor Research and Education (UNICOS), aimed at building a skilled semiconductor workforce, which aligns with the high-tech talent needs of space science. (U.S. Congressman Blake Moore, FY2026)</li>
<li><strong>Pro-Innovation and Economic Growth Stance:</strong> Representative Moore's public statements emphasize economic growth, strategic investments, and the importance of funding "the right programs" to strengthen the U.S. economy and national security, aligning with the economic and technological benefits of NASA science. (YouTube, 2024-11)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Limited Direct Influence on Space Policy:</strong> Representative Moore holds no current assignments on committees directly overseeing NASA or space policy in the 119th Congress, which may limit his direct legislative influence on NASA's Science Mission Directorate activities. (Authoritative Committee Data, 2025-09)</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism and Spending Restraint:</strong> Representative Moore has consistently advocated for fiscal responsibility and reducing government spending, including his vote for the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, which could lead to resistance against significant increases in NASA's overall science budget. (Congress.gov, 2023-05; Rep. Moore Press Release, 2023-05)</li>
<li><strong>Prioritization of Economic and National Security Returns:</strong> While supportive of NASA-funded projects in his district, Representative Moore's public statements often emphasize the contributions of these activities to "national security and economic prosperity," potentially indicating a preference for applied research with clear tangible benefits over broader foundational space science. (Rep. Moore Press Release, 2023-06; Utah State Today, 2023-06)</li>
