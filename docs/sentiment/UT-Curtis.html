<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Senator Curtis's strong emphasis on fiscal conservatism and reducing government spending presents a significant challenge to advocating for increased NASA science funding, especially given the proposed 47% budget cut for FY2026. While he champions science-based solutions, his focus on environmental and applied sciences might lead him to scrutinize investments in fundamental research like astrophysics or planetary science if they don't demonstrate direct economic or energy benefits.</p>
<p>However, his position on the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation provides a direct avenue for influence over NASA's budget. Crucially, Utah benefits from substantial NASA science investments across multiple disciplines, including heliophysics, Earth science, planetary science, and biological and physical sciences, with significant contracts and grants flowing to local institutions. Highlighting these tangible local economic and research contributions, coupled with his stated support for science-based environmental solutions, could make him receptive to arguments for robust and diverse NASA science funding.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider gathering specific examples of how NASA science investments directly benefit Utah's economy and workforce, particularly highlighting companies in Provo or research at BYU and USU, to connect with Senator Curtis's business background and local ties.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's Earth Science activities, particularly those related to wildfire risk reduction, water resource management, or climate monitoring, provide science-based solutions directly relevant to Utah's environmental challenges and align with Senator Curtis's leadership in the Conservative Climate Caucus.</li>
<li>Look into how NASA's broader science portfolio, beyond Earth science, contributes to technological innovation, STEM workforce development, and long-term economic benefits for the nation, framing these investments as fiscally responsible and high-return.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About John R. Curtis</h2>
<ul>
<li>Graduated from Brigham Young University with a degree in business management.</li>
<li>Served as COO of a Provo-based company, Action Target, starting in 2000.</li>
<li>As Provo Mayor, he supported Google Fiber's acquisition of the city's fiber network.</li>
<li>Founded and chairs the Conservative Climate Caucus, advocating for science-based environmental solutions.</li>
<li>Co-sponsored the Fix Our Forests Act to improve forest management for wildfire risk reduction.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key Committee Membership:</strong> Senator Curtis's position as a Member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation provides direct oversight of NASA's budget and policy, including its Science Mission Directorate. (space_committees, 2025-09-24)</li>
<li><strong>Significant Local NASA Science Investment:</strong> Utah institutions and companies, including Utah State University, University of Utah, Brigham Young University, and Care Weather Technologies, have received substantial NASA contracts and grants for science activities in heliophysics, Earth science, planetary science, and biological and physical sciences, demonstrating a strong local economic and research interest. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Leadership in Science-Based Environmental Solutions:</strong> Senator Curtis founded and chairs the Conservative Climate Caucus, advocating for science-based environmental solutions, which aligns with the objectives of NASA's Earth Science division. (biography, 2025-09-24)</li>
<li><strong>Support for Earth Science-Related Legislation:</strong> Co-sponsorship of the Fix Our Forests Act demonstrates an interest in science-informed approaches to environmental challenges, which can be supported by NASA's Earth observation capabilities and is relevant to Utah's wildfire risks. (biography, 2025-09-24)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Senator Curtis consistently emphasizes fiscal responsibility, cutting government spending, and reducing the national debt, which could lead to scrutiny of proposed increases in NASA's science budget. (John Curtis Campaign Website, undated; Senator John Curtis, 2025-08-09)</li>
<li><strong>Prioritization of Applied/Earth Science:</strong> As founder of the Conservative Climate Caucus, Senator Curtis prioritizes "science-based environmental solutions" and energy policies, potentially leading to a preference for Earth science or applied research with direct economic or energy benefits over fundamental research in other NASA science disciplines. (Utah Foundation, 2024-11-11; Wikipedia, 2021; Senator John Curtis, 2025-06-10)</li>
<li><strong>Skepticism of Government Regulation:</strong> Senator Curtis has expressed a desire to reduce "red tape and uncertainty" for businesses and has supported overturning federal regulations, which may translate to a critical view of large, government-led science programs if perceived as inefficient or overly bureaucratic. (The Business Download, 2025-06-24; The Freedom Index, 2025-04-10)</li>
<li><strong>Limited Direct Subcommittee Oversight of NASA:</strong> While a member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, Senator Curtis is assigned to the Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Technology, and Data Privacy, rather than the Subcommittee on Aviation, Space, and Innovation, which directly oversees NASA. (U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, &amp; Transportation, undated)</li>
