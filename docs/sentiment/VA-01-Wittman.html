<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Wittman's emphasis on national security in space and his consistent calls for fiscal responsibility suggest he may be cautious about increasing NASA science funding. His lack of a direct role on space-specific committees and a reported negative net NASA science spending in the district over the past three years could also present challenges to advocacy for broad investments. While he supports federal research, his specific focus on environmental issues like Chesapeake Bay restoration might narrow his interest within NASA's diverse science portfolio.</p>
<p>However, there are clear avenues for engagement. His strong support for STEM education and general advocacy for federal research investment align well with NASA's broader mission. Notably, local institutions like the Virginia Institute of Marine Science and the College of William and Mary have received NASA grants for Earth and Planetary science, demonstrating direct district benefits. Highlighting these local impacts and connecting NASA's science mission to STEM workforce development and national research priorities could make a compelling case for preserving and growing NASA's science budget, particularly given the massive proposed cuts.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching the specific applications of the NASA Earth Science grant at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science to demonstrate how local research directly supports environmental stewardship and Chesapeake Bay health, aligning with his professional background and committee priorities.</li>
<li>Explore how the NASA-funded planetary science research at the College of William and Mary contributes to broader scientific discovery and STEM workforce development, reinforcing his stated support for federal research investment and the importance of a diverse science portfolio.</li>
<li>Look into the economic impact and technological spin-offs from NASA science investments, including the local contract with Anton Paar USA, to demonstrate the return on investment and how civil space science underpins national technological capabilities, addressing concerns about fiscal responsibility and defense-centric space focus.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Robert J. Wittman</h2>
<ul>
<li>Holds a B.S. in Biology, a Master's in Public Health, and a Ph.D.</li>
<li>Served 20 years with the Virginia Department of Health as an environmental health specialist.</li>
<li>Was Field Director for Virginia's Division of Shellfish Sanitation.</li>
<li>Authored legislation concerning Chesapeake Bay restoration and offshore wind energy.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Support for STEM Education:</strong> Representative Wittman has recently emphasized the importance of STEM education for Virginia's economy and workforce, hosting a seminar with National Science Foundation leaders in December 2023 and publishing an article on the topic in January 2024. This aligns with NASA's broader efforts to inspire and develop the next generation of scientists and engineers.</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for Federal Research Investment:</strong> In March 2025, Representative Wittman advocated for Virginia's research institutions to receive critical federal medical research funding, urging the National Institutes of Health to reconsider proposed funding caps, demonstrating a general posture of supporting federal investment in scientific research. He also stated in April 2025 that "when we invest in research, we're not just fueling scientific" advancements.</li>
<li><strong>Local NASA Earth Science Research:</strong> The Virginia Institute of Marine Science in Gloucester Point, VA, within his district, received a $1.1 million NASA grant for using satellite remote sensing data to predict the export and fate of Net Primary Production in oceans, directly supporting NASA's Earth Science activities. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Local NASA Planetary Science Research:</strong> The College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, VA, also within his district, received a NASA grant for numerical modeling studies related to the structural and tectonic histories of planetary bodies, directly supporting NASA's Planetary Science activities. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Environmental Science Background and Natural Resources Committee Leadership:</strong> Representative Wittman holds degrees in Biology and Public Health, served as an environmental health specialist, and is currently Vice Chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee for the 119th Congress, where he advocates for environmental stewardship and Chesapeake Bay restoration. [cite: biography, 6, 17] This background and committee role align with the goals of NASA's Earth Science Mission Directorate, and he works across the aisle on bipartisan legislation for the Chesapeake Bay.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Defense-Centric Space Focus:</strong> His prominent roles on the House Armed Services Committee and statements emphasizing space as a domain for national security and competition with China suggest a primary focus on military space applications, which could potentially divert attention or resources from civil space science. (USNI News, 2025-02-12; Rep. Wittman Press Release, 2024-12-11)</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal Scrutiny and Spending Reduction:</strong> Representative Wittman consistently advocates for fiscal responsibility, eliminating wasteful spending, and aligning federal budgets with spending caps, indicating a posture that may lead to scrutiny of NASA's budget for potential cuts or efficiency measures. (Rep. Wittman Press Release, 2025-05-11; Congress.gov, 2024-05-02)</li>
<li><strong>Absence of Direct Space Science Committee Role:</strong> Lacking a current assignment on space-specific committees, Representative Wittman may have fewer direct opportunities or less dedicated legislative leverage to champion the full breadth of NASA's Science Mission Directorate activities. (space_committees)</li>
<li><strong>Prioritization of Specific Environmental Science:</strong> While possessing a science background and supporting environmental research, his public record emphasizes specific environmental issues like Chesapeake Bay restoration and aquatic research, potentially leading to a more focused advocacy for Earth science relevant to these areas rather than broader NASA science disciplines.
