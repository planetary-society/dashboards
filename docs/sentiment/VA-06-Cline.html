<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Appropriations</li>
<li>Member, House Committee on Appropriations: Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Cline's strong fiscal conservatism, particularly as Chair of the Republican Study Committee's Budget and Spending Task Force, suggests a skeptical stance towards increasing federal discretionary spending, including for NASA science. His voting record also indicates potential resistance to certain Earth science and climate-related initiatives, which comprise a significant portion of NASA's science portfolio. Furthermore, his emphasis on spending accountability and competing priorities like national defense may make advocating for a 47% budget cut reversal challenging.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, Representative Cline's position on the House Appropriations Committee and its Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee provides a critical opportunity for direct engagement on NASA's budget. Moreover, the significant NASA science contracts and grants totaling over $2.7 million in his district, supporting local entities like Dynamic Aviation, Panamerica Computers, and James Madison University in Earth science, astrophysics, and exploration, offer a compelling argument for the tangible economic and research benefits of these investments within VA-06. This local impact, combined with his general support for scientific R&amp;D, creates a potential opening for advocacy.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider preparing specific examples of how NASA science investments, like those with Dynamic Aviation or James Madison University, directly benefit constituents and the economy in Virginia's 6th District, connecting federal funding to local jobs and innovation.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's science programs align with principles of fiscal responsibility and accountability, demonstrating efficient use of taxpayer dollars and a strong return on investment in areas important to national competitiveness and security.</li>
<li>Look into specific NASA science initiatives in the district, such as astrophysics research at James Madison University or Hubble Space Telescope support by Panamerica Computers, to highlight areas of scientific advancement that may align with his broader interest in research and development.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Ben Cline</h2>
<ul>
<li>Graduated from Bates College (B.A., 1994) and University of Richmond School of Law (J.D., 2007).</li>
<li>Served as Chief of Staff for U.S. Representative Bob Goodlatte (1994-2002).</li>
<li>President of NDS Corporation, assisting rural Internet and technology businesses (2002-2007).</li>
<li>Practiced law, including as an Assistant Commonwealth's Attorney.</li>
<li>Served 16 years in the Virginia House of Delegates (2002-2018).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key Appropriations Committee Role:</strong> As a member of the House Committee on Appropriations and its Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee, Representative Cline holds a direct and influential position over NASA's budget, including its science and exploration programs. This role provides an avenue for direct engagement and negotiation on funding levels for agencies like NASA. (House Committee on Appropriations, Current)</li>
<li><strong>District's Engagement in NASA Science and Exploration:</strong> NASA contracts and grants totaling over $2.7 million for entities in VA-06 directly support various science and exploration activities, demonstrating local engagement and economic benefit. Dynamic Aviation Group in Bridgewater conducts airborne data acquisitions for Earth science missions, Panamerica Computers in Luray supports Hubble Space Telescope infrastructure, and James Madison University in Harrisonburg performs research in Earth science, astrophysics, and lunar/Mars exploration. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>General Support for Scientific Research and Development:</strong> Representative Cline has publicly stated his support for "investing in scientific research and development" when voting on appropriations bills that include NASA's budget, indicating a general positive disposition towards the broader scientific enterprise. (Ben Cline, 2023-07-27), (Ben Cline, 2024-07-17)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Representative Cline, as Chair of the Republican Study Committee's Budget and Spending Task Force, advocates for significant federal spending cuts and balancing the budget, which could constrain NASA's funding. (Ben Cline, 2023-06; Ben Cline, 2024-03)</li>
<li><strong>Skepticism of Earth Science/Climate Initiatives:</strong> His voting record includes "Nay" votes on bills such as the Carbon Sequestration Collaboration Act and the Abandoned Well Remediation Research and Development Act, indicating potential resistance to funding certain Earth science-related activities. (House.gov, 2024-04; League of Conservation Voters, 2024)</li>
<li><strong>Focus on Spending Accountability in Research:</strong> Representative Cline introduced the Federal Grant Accountability Act to ensure taxpayer-funded federal grants are used solely for research projects, not Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, suggesting a desire for strict oversight on how federal research funds are allocated. (Ben Cline, 2023-12)</li>
<li><strong>Competing Priorities in Appropriations:</strong> As a member of the House Committee on Appropriations, his public statements emphasize support for national defense and veterans' healthcare, which may lead to prioritization of these areas over other discretionary spending, including science. (Ben Cline, 2023-07; Royal Examiner, 2023-06)</li>
