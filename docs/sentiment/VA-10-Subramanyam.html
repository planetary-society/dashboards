    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.

<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Subramanyam is likely to be receptive to advocacy for NASA science given his position on the House Science Committee and his strong public statements against budget cuts, emphasizing NASA as a critical investment. His district also benefits substantially from NASA science contracts and grants, particularly in Earth science, astrophysics, and heliophysics, which provides a tangible local economic and scientific interest.</p>
<p>However, while he has advocated for fully funding NASA and restoring cuts, his public record does not explicitly detail a push for significant <em>growth</em> in the science budget beyond existing or restored levels. Advocates should highlight the specific impacts of the proposed 47% FY2026 science budget cut on his district's projects and workforce, and frame increased investment as essential for maintaining U.S. leadership and maximizing returns on existing infrastructure, rather than just preventing cuts.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider gathering specific examples of how NASA science contracts and grants in VA-10, such as those with Northrop Grumman or Bae Systems, directly support local jobs and economic growth, reinforcing his view of NASA as a strong investment.</li>
<li>Explore how increased investment in NASA's space science activities, particularly in areas like data analytics or advanced instrumentation, aligns with his background in technology policy and his support for interagency research collaboration.</li>
<li>Look into how NASA's science missions, including Earth science projects in his district, provide tangible benefits that address his broader legislative priorities, such as environmental protection or workforce development, demonstrating a high return on investment.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Suhas Subramanyam</h2>
<ul>
<li>Served as a White House technology policy advisor in the Obama administration.</li>
<li>Led a White House task force on technology policy and IT modernization.</li>
<li>Practiced law and owned a business in the technology sector.</li>
<li>Previously served in both the Virginia House of Delegates and Senate.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>House Science Committee Membership:</strong> Representative Subramanyam is a member of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, which has direct jurisdiction over NASA, indicating a formal role in shaping space policy and oversight of federal scientific research and development.</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for Full NASA Funding:</strong> He publicly stated, "We have to fully fund NASA" and "NASA is one of the best investments we can make in the country" at a protest outside NASA headquarters, emphasizing support for the agency's budget and workforce.</li>
<li><strong>Opposition to Funding Cuts:</strong> Representative Subramanyam voted "Nay" on the Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2026 (H.R.5371) on September 19, 2025, citing concerns about "continually cutting... funding to critical research and critical programs."</li>
<li><strong>Strong Local NASA Presence:</strong> His district, VA-10, hosts significant NASA contracts and grants for companies like Northrop Grumman and Orbital Sciences in Dulles and Sterling, and Bae Systems and Lynker in Manassas and Leesburg, supporting Earth science, astrophysics, and heliophysics missions. [cite: USAspending, FY2022-FY2024]</li>
<li><strong>Support for Interagency Science Collaboration:</strong> He co-sponsored H.R.1368, the DOE and NASA Interagency Research Coordination Act, introduced on February 14, 2025, which aims to establish a formal partnership for collaborative research and development furthering both agencies' missions, including dark matter research and data sharing.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Broad Legislative Agenda:</strong> Representative Subramanyam's public priorities encompass a wide array of issues, including healthcare, environmental protection, and federal workforce concerns, which may divert attention from advocating for increased NASA science investment. (Suhas for Virginia, 2024; GovExec, 2024-12; Rep. Subramanyam Press Release, 2025-07)</li>
<li><strong>Focus on Efficiency and Modernization:</strong> His stated commitment to "modernize government services to increase efficiency and reduce costs to taxpayers" could lead to a prioritization of operational improvements over new funding for science programs in budget discussions. (Rep. Subramanyam Press Release, 2025-01)</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for Current Funding Levels:</strong> While Representative Subramanyam has strongly advocated for fully funding NASA and restoring budget cuts, his public statements do not explicitly detail a push for substantial <em>growth</em> in NASA's science budget beyond existing or restored levels. (Space.com, 2025-09; DCMediaGroup, 2025-09)</li>
