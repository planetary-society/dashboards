    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.
    All AI-generated claims, assessments, and recommendations should be independently verified.

<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative DelBene's background in biology and technology, coupled with her advocacy for R&amp;D investment and opposition to federal research cuts, suggests a foundational appreciation for scientific endeavors. Her district benefits significantly from NASA Science Mission Directorate contracts, particularly with Aerojet Rocketdyne for robotic science missions and the Roman Space Telescope, and grants to Northwest Research Associates for heliophysics and Earth science. These direct economic ties and her support for Earth science initiatives like the National Landslide Preparedness Act provide strong local and policy alignment opportunities for advocating against the proposed 47% cut to NASA's science budget.</p>
<p>However, her legislative priorities are broad, and she does not serve on space-related committees, which may limit her direct engagement with broader space science issues. While supportive of science, her public statements often emphasize Earth science for terrestrial benefits, potentially requiring advocates to broaden her focus beyond climate and disaster preparedness to other critical science disciplines like astrophysics and planetary science. As a member of the House Ways and Means Committee, her focus on fiscal responsibility means advocates should be prepared to articulate the tangible benefits and economic returns of NASA science investments to counter budgetary scrutiny.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider connecting NASA's space science investments to the broader innovation ecosystem and R&amp;D competitiveness that Representative DelBene has championed, drawing on her background in biology and technology leadership.</li>
<li>Explore how specific NASA Science Mission Directorate contracts and grants within her district, such as those with Aerojet Rocketdyne and Northwest Research Associates, directly create high-tech jobs and foster local economic growth.</li>
<li>Look into how investments across all NASA science disciplines, including astrophysics and planetary science, contribute to foundational scientific knowledge and technological advancements that ultimately benefit society and maintain U.S. leadership, aligning with her general support for scientific inquiry and responsible investment.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Suzan K. DelBene</h2>
<ul>
<li>Earned a Bachelor's degree in biology from Reed College.</li>
<li>Holds a Master's degree in business administration from the University of Washington.</li>
<li>Worked at Microsoft in marketing, business development, and product management roles.</li>
<li>Co-founded drugstore.com and served as CEO of Nimble Technology.</li>
<li>Served as Director for the Washington State Department of Revenue.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Support for R&amp;D Investment:</strong> Representative DelBene reintroduced the bipartisan American Innovation and R&amp;D Competitiveness Act in March 2025, which permanently allows for immediate research and development expensing, indicating a commitment to fostering innovation and scientific advancement. This legislation directly benefits technology and research-intensive companies in her district, such as Aerojet Rocketdyne in Redmond, which holds significant NASA Science Mission Directorate contracts. [cite: 1, contracts]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Opposition to Research Funding Cuts:</strong> In February 2025, Representative DelBene highlighted the negative impact of federal research cuts on medical research, demonstrating a general stance against reducing funding for scientific inquiry. She also co-sponsored a congressional resolution in September 2025 designating Medical Research Week, honoring contributions of medical research.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Direct District Engagement with NASA Science:</strong> Her district benefits from substantial NASA Science Mission Directorate contracts and grants, including over $47 million to Aerojet Rocketdyne for ion propulsion technology for robotic science missions and Roman Space Telescope thrusters, and grants to Northwest Research Associates for heliophysics and Earth science research. [cite: contracts] This direct economic and scientific connection provides a strong local incentive for supporting NASA science.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Background in Science and Technology:</strong> Representative DelBene holds a Bachelor's degree in biology and has a career history as a technology entrepreneur and business leader, including roles at Microsoft and as CEO of Nimble Technology. [cite: biography, 4, 6] This background suggests an inherent understanding and appreciation for scientific and technological endeavors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Advocacy for Earth Science and Environmental Preparedness:</strong> Representative DelBene has actively supported legislation like the National Landslide Preparedness Act, which she reintroduced in March 2025, aiming to improve natural disaster preparedness through enhanced hazard science and mapping. This aligns with NASA's Earth Science mission, which provides critical data for environmental monitoring and understanding.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competing Legislative Priorities:</strong> Representative DelBene's public record consistently highlights a broad range of legislative priorities including healthcare, affordable housing, climate change, and economic issues, with less frequent public emphasis on broader space science and exploration beyond its economic impact or specific Earth science applications.</li>
<li><strong>Absence from Space-Related Committees:</strong> Representative DelBene does not hold any current committee assignments directly related to space, which may limit her direct engagement and advocacy for NASA's Science Mission Directorate activities within the legislative process.</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on Earth Science for Terrestrial Benefit:</strong> While supportive of science, her public statements regarding environmental and scientific research often focus on Earth science applications directly addressing climate change and natural disaster preparedness, potentially prioritizing these over other space science disciplines like astrophysics or planetary science.</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal Scrutiny and Budgetary Focus:</strong> As a member of the House Ways and Means Committee and a proponent of "long-term budget solutions" and "cutting wasteful spending," she may scrutinize federal expenditures, including those for NASA science, through a lens of economic impact and direct benefit to working families.</li>
