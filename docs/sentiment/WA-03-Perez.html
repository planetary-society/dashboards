    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.

<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Appropriations</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Gluesenkamp Perez's position on the House Appropriations Committee means she balances numerous federal spending priorities, and her stated commitment to fiscal discipline may lead to scrutiny of large budget increases. While her district benefits from some NASA contracts, these are not explicitly tied to the Science Mission Directorate, potentially limiting direct local advocacy points for specific science programs. Her public statements also tend to prioritize local economic and community needs, and she has not explicitly championed NASA science or exploration in public records.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, her role on Appropriations provides a direct avenue for influence, and her general concern about cuts to research funding suggests a potential receptiveness to federal science investments. Her co-sponsorship of space-related legislation and the presence of NASA contracts, including a $1.5 million award to Nlight Inc. in her district, demonstrate existing ties to the space sector. Furthermore, a local NASA grant for science communication indicates a community interest in scientific engagement that could be leveraged.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching how the advanced manufacturing capabilities of companies like Nlight Inc. and Tfi-Telemark, supported by NASA contracts, contribute to high-tech job creation and economic diversification within her district, aligning with her background in manufacturing and small business.</li>
<li>Explore how investments in NASA's space science activities generate broader economic returns, foster STEM workforce development, or lead to commercial spin-offs that could benefit Southwest Washington, addressing her focus on fiscal discipline and local economic needs.</li>
<li>Look into specific NASA science missions or discoveries that demonstrate clear societal benefits, technological innovation, or inspire STEM education, connecting to her stated concern for research funding and engagement with space-related legislation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Marie Gluesenkamp Perez</h2>
<ul>
<li>Earned an economics degree from Reed College in 2012.</li>
<li>Co-owns and operates an automobile repair shop.</li>

</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Appropriations Committee Role:</strong> As a Member of the House Committee on Appropriations, Representative Gluesenkamp Perez holds a position with direct influence over federal discretionary spending, including NASA's budget for science and exploration programs.</li>
<li><strong>Local Space Technology Contracts:</strong> Her district benefits from NASA contracts, such as the $1.5 million awarded to Nlight Inc. for high-efficiency laser diode modules, demonstrating local economic ties to advanced space technology development. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Support for Research Funding:</strong> Representative Gluesenkamp Perez has expressed concern about potential cuts to research funding, stating that a government shutdown could impact "research into cancer treatments for kids," indicating a general posture against reductions in federal research investments.</li>
<li><strong>Engagement in Space Legislation:</strong> In July 2025, she co-sponsored H.R. 4336, known as the "CBP SPACE Act," indicating direct engagement with legislation pertaining to space, alongside bipartisan colleagues.</li>
<li><strong>Local Science Communication Investment:</strong> A NASA grant was awarded to the Association of Science Communicators in her district for science communication training, highlighting local investment in public engagement with scientific endeavors. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competing Priorities on Appropriations Committee:</strong> As a member of the House Committee on Appropriations, Representative Gluesenkamp Perez is responsible for allocating funding across the entire federal government, which necessitates balancing numerous competing priorities.</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on Fiscal Discipline and Transparency:</strong> Representative Gluesenkamp Perez has publicly stated her commitment to fiscal discipline and transparency, and has been recognized for efforts to improve the nation's fiscal trajectory, which could lead to scrutiny of spending on science programs.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on Local Economic and Community Needs:</strong> Her public statements and actions prioritize federal investments that directly benefit Southwest Washington's communities, rural economies, and workforce development, potentially favoring programs with clear, immediate local impact.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Explicit Advocacy for NASA Science/Exploration:</strong> While generally supportive of research and development and STEM, public records do not show specific statements or legislative actions directly championing NASA's Science Mission Directorate or human exploration programs.</li>
<li><strong>Indirect Local NASA Contract Relevance:</strong> While her district has some NASA contracts, their descriptions do not explicitly detail direct ties to specific Science Mission Directorate activities (astrophysics, planetary science, heliophysics, Earth science, biological and physical sciences) or exploration programs, potentially limiting direct local advocacy points for these specific areas.
