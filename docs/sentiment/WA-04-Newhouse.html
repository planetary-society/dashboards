<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Appropriations</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Newhouse's strong fiscal conservatism and consistent advocacy for reduced government spending, coupled with the complete absence of NASA Science Mission Directorate contracts or grants in his district, suggest a challenging environment for advocating increased funding. His legislative priorities tend to focus on agricultural security and local economic development, which may overshadow federal science initiatives lacking direct local ties. Furthermore, his skepticism towards certain federal environmental regulations could make advocacy for Earth science programs particularly difficult, especially in light of a proposed 47% cut to NASA Science in FY2026.</p>
<p>However, as a member of the House Appropriations Committee, Representative Newhouse holds a key position to influence funding decisions. His consistent support for the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and broader commitment to research and development funding, including for biotechnology and critical minerals, indicate an appreciation for scientific innovation and "hard science." Advocates could frame NASA's space science as vital national R&amp;D, emphasizing its role in maintaining U.S. scientific leadership and technological advancement, potentially appealing to his support for national laboratory science despite the lack of direct local NASA economic ties.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching specific NASA science missions or technologies that align with the research areas of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) or his stated interest in energy and critical minerals, to highlight shared scientific goals.</li>
<li>Look into specific NASA science applications, such as Earth observation for agricultural monitoring or advanced materials research, that could resonate with his background in agriculture and his advocacy for biotechnology innovation.</li>
<li>Explore how robust investment in NASA's science portfolio contributes to broader national economic competitiveness, technological leadership, and the development of a skilled workforce, framing it as a strategic, long-term investment rather than just spending.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Dan Newhouse</h2>
<ul>
<li>Holds a Bachelor of Science in agricultural economics from Washington State University.</li>
<li>Served as Director of the Washington State Department of Agriculture.</li>
<li>Operates a 600-acre farm, cultivating hops, tree fruit, grapes, and alfalfa.</li>
<li>Led a 2024 letter advocating for U.S. biotechnology and alternative protein innovation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Appropriations Committee Influence:</strong> As a Member of the House Committee on Appropriations, Representative Newhouse holds a direct position to influence federal funding decisions, including those for NASA's Science Mission Directorate activities. (Authoritative Committee Data)</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for National Laboratory Science:</strong> Representative Newhouse has consistently supported the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) in his district, highlighting its "scientific brilliance" and crucial research in energy, national security, and environmental challenges, and questioned proposed staffing cuts to national labs, emphasizing "hard science." (Newhouse.house.gov, 2025; Forbes, 2025-05)</li>
<li><strong>Commitment to Research and Development Funding:</strong> Representative Newhouse has supported appropriations bills that include significant investments in research and development, such as for small modular nuclear reactors and critical minerals extraction, demonstrating a broader commitment to technological advancement and scientific innovation. (Newhouse.house.gov, 2025-09)</li>
<li><strong>Support for Biotechnology Innovation:</strong> Representative Newhouse led a 2024 letter advocating for U.S. biotechnology and alternative protein innovation, which suggests a general interest in and support for scientific and technological progress. (Biography, 2024)</li>
<li><strong>Higher Education in Science-Related Field:</strong> His Bachelor of Science degree in agricultural economics from Washington State University, a prominent research institution, provides a foundational understanding of scientific principles and research. (Biography, 1977)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of Direct NASA SMD Economic Ties:</strong> The 4th Congressional District of Washington has no relevant NASA Science Mission Directorate contracts or grants identified in recent records. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Strong Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Representative Newhouse consistently advocates for reining in government spending and addressing the national debt, supporting legislation aimed at "fiscal sanity" and limiting "inflationary spending."</li>
<li><strong>Prioritization of Agricultural and Local Economic Issues:</strong> His legislative focus and public statements frequently emphasize agricultural security, water infrastructure, and local economic development, indicating these are primary concerns.</li>
<li><strong>Skepticism Towards Certain Federal Environmental Regulations/Earth Science Approaches:</strong> He has expressed concerns about "burdensome governmental regulations" related to energy and environmental issues, preferring voluntary conservation and local control over federal mandates.</li>
<li><strong>Record of Supporting Federal Spending Cuts:</strong> He has voted for and supported appropriations bills that include cuts to federal programs, emphasizing the need to reduce "wasteful spending."</li>
