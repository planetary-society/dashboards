<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Appropriations</li>
<li>Ex Officio, Senate Committee on Appropriations: Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Senator Murray, as Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, has a strong record of supporting NASA's Science Mission Directorate, having rejected proposed cuts to numerous missions in previous budgets and explicitly opposing the drastic FY2026 proposed reductions. Her advocacy has directly secured funding for biological and physical sciences in her state, and she has highlighted the importance of climate research, aligning with NASA's Earth science efforts. The substantial NASA science contracts and grants awarded to entities in Washington State, including Aerojet Rocketdyne, Blue Origin, and the University of Washington, further demonstrate a clear local economic and scientific interest in these programs.</p>
<p>Despite this strong foundation of support and direct local benefit, Senator Murray's extensive legislative agenda encompasses a wide range of national priorities, creating significant competition for federal discretionary spending. While she has proven to be a protector of NASA science funding, securing substantial new investments may be challenging given these competing demands. Advocates can be guardedly optimistic, leveraging her past actions and the local impact of NASA science to reinforce the value of continued and increased investment.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider gathering personal stories from individuals, students, or researchers at Washington State University, the University of Washington, or other local entities benefiting from NASA science grants and contracts, especially those related to the BioS-ENDURES Consortium or Earth science, to connect investments to her constituents and priorities.</li>
<li>Explore Senator Murray's recent statements and actions as Senate Appropriations Chair, specifically her advocacy for climate research and opposition to proposed cuts to NASA's Science Mission Directorate, to frame your request for increased investment within her established priorities.</li>
<li>Look into how NASA's science missions and related grants, such as the Northwest Earth and Space Science Pathways program, directly contribute to STEM education and workforce development across Washington, aligning with her background as an educator and advocate for educational issues.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Patty Murray</h2>
<ul>
<li>Graduated Washington State University with a physical education degree (1972).</li>
<li>Worked as a preschool teacher and parenting instructor at community college.</li>
<li>Served on local school board and in the Washington State Senate.</li>
<li>Long-time advocate for environmental and education issues.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Appropriations Leadership for NASA Funding:</strong> As Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Murray oversaw the FY2025 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (CJS) bill, which proposed $25.43 billion for NASA, a $559 million increase over FY2024, and maintained near-level funding for the Science Mission Directorate, rejecting proposed cuts to 55 missions and STEM engagement. This demonstrates direct influence and support for NASA's overall budget and science activities. (SpacePolicyOnline, 2024-07; AIP.ORG, 2025-07)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Investment in Space Biological and Physical Sciences:</strong> Senator Murray authored a provision in the FY2024 government spending bill that secured $2.5 million for a NASA award to establish the BioS-ENDURES Consortium at the University of Washington, in partnership with Washington State University and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, focusing on human-plant-microbiome relationships in space. This directly supports NASA's Biological and Physical Sciences. (Sen. Murray Press Release, 2024-10)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support for Lunar Exploration and Scientific Discovery:</strong> Senator Murray applauded NASA's May 2023 selection of Kent, WA-based Blue Origin to develop a human landing system for the Artemis V mission, emphasizing the role of space exploration in scientific discovery and inspiring future generations. Blue Origin also holds a Commercial Lunar Payload Services contract. (Sen. Murray Press Release, 2023-05; USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Opposition to Proposed Cuts to NASA Science:</strong> In May 2025, as Ranking Member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Murray issued a statement strongly opposing the President's FY2026 budget request, which proposed a 47% cut to NASA's Science Mission Directorate, stating it would "cancel numerous current and planned missions to better understand our universe, solar system, and Earth." This indicates a clear stance against reductions in NASA's science portfolio. (Sen. Murray Press Release, 2025-05)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Advocacy for Earth Science and Climate Research:</strong> As Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Murray highlighted in July 2023 that the FY2024 CJS bill she helped write included investments in "advancing climate research" and "continuing America's leadership in space." This aligns with NASA's Earth science activities, and the University of Washington and Earth and Space Research in Seattle have received NASA grants for Earth science and climate-related projects. (Sen. Murray Press Release, 2023-07; USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Broad Legislative Agenda:</strong> Senator Murray's extensive legislative agenda prioritizes a wide array of issues, including healthcare, education, climate action, and economic growth, which may lead to competing demands for federal discretionary spending and potentially limit the magnitude of growth for NASA science activities, even with her general support.</li>
