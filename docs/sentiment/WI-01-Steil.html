    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.

<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Steil's consistent focus on fiscal conservatism and limiting government spending, evidenced by votes like the Fiscal Responsibility Act, suggests a cautious approach to increasing discretionary federal budgets, including for NASA science. His past opposition to broad federal science and technology investments, such as the CHIPS Act, and his primary legislative focus on financial technology and AI, indicate that significant new federal spending on space science may face an uphill battle. Furthermore, his skepticism regarding climate-related regulations could pose a challenge for advocating for NASA's Earth science programs.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, there are compelling local connections that could foster receptiveness. NASA science investments directly benefit his district through contracts like the $847,000 award to Owens Industries for spaceflight hardware fabrication and grants to Carthage College for microgravity research, aligning with his support for Wisconsin manufacturing and R&amp;D. Framing increased NASA science funding as an investment in local jobs, advanced manufacturing, and U.S. innovation and competitiveness, a principle he champions, offers a potential pathway for positive engagement.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider highlighting how NASA science investments directly benefit local businesses like Owens Industries and academic institutions like Carthage College, connecting federal funding to job creation and research opportunities in WI-01.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's role in fostering U.S. innovation and technological leadership aligns with Representative Steil's focus on national competitiveness, particularly in areas like advanced manufacturing and R&amp;D.</li>
<li>Look into Representative Steil's past engagement with higher education and local economic development initiatives to frame NASA science funding as a strategic investment in Wisconsin's future workforce and technological capabilities.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Bryan Steil</h2>
<ul>
<li>Earned B.S. in business administration from Georgetown; J.D. from University of Wisconsin Law.</li>
<li>Worked as an attorney and executive in the manufacturing industry for a decade.</li>
<li>Served on the University of Wisconsin Board of Regents prior to congressional election.</li>
<li>No direct public record of military service or specific STEM/space professional background.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Local NASA-related Manufacturing:</strong> Owens Industries in Oak Creek, WI (within WI-01), received a NASA contract for fabrication services for instruments and spaceflight hardware, demonstrating direct local economic benefit from NASA's science mission. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Local NASA-funded Academic Research:</strong> Carthage College in Kenosha, WI (within WI-01), received a NASA grant for microgravity research, linking federal science investment to local higher education and scientific advancement. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support for Wisconsin Manufacturing and R&amp;D:</strong> Representative Steil has publicly supported federal investments in Wisconsin research and manufacturing, emphasizing "innovative, lifesaving research" and the importance of onshoring production, which aligns with the advanced manufacturing needs of NASA science missions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Advocacy for U.S. Innovation and Competitiveness:</strong> As Chairman of the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology and Artificial Intelligence, he has emphasized ensuring U.S. leadership in innovation and development, a principle that could extend to space science for national competitiveness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Engagement with Higher Education:</strong> His past service on the University of Wisconsin Board of Regents (prior to 2019) and his office's provision of federal grant resources indicate a general understanding and support for higher education and research institutions, which are key partners in NASA science.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Representative Steil has consistently voted for legislation aimed at limiting government spending and reducing the national debt, such as the Fiscal Responsibility Act in June 2023 and House budget resolutions in 2025, indicating a general posture of fiscal restraint that could impact discretionary spending for NASA science.</li>
<li><strong>Competing Legislative Priorities:</strong> As Chairman of the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology, and Artificial Intelligence, Representative Steil's primary legislative focus is on cryptocurrency regulation and AI, which may divert attention and resources from space science advocacy.</li>
<li><strong>Skepticism of Broad Federal Science/Technology Investment:</strong> Representative Steil opposed the CHIPS Act, which included significant funding for the National Science Foundation and Department of Energy research, reflecting a skepticism towards large-scale federal investments in science and technology perceived as "corporate welfare."</li>
<li><strong>Opposition to Climate-Related Regulations:</strong> Representative Steil has expressed concerns about "heavy-handed federal regulations" and "overreach" in climate policy, voting against the Climate Action Now Act in 2019 and opposing the SEC's Climate Disclosure Proposal in 2022, which could pose a risk to NASA's Earth science activities tied to climate research.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Direct Space-Related Committee Assignment:</strong> Representative Steil does not hold any current space-related committee assignments in the 119th Congress, which may limit his direct engagement and influence on NASA's budget and policy decisions. (space_committees)</li>
