<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Appropriations</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Pocan's deep dissatisfaction with the current appropriations process and his consistent prioritization of social programs, healthcare, and education present significant hurdles for securing increased NASA space science funding. While he generally opposes cuts to scientific research, his emphasis on fiscal scrutiny and eliminating perceived wasteful spending means any request for new investment will face close examination within a challenging budgetary environment.</p>
<p>However, as a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee, Representative Pocan holds a powerful position to influence NASA's budget. His district directly benefits from substantial NASA Science Mission Directorate contracts and grants, particularly in Earth science and planetary science research at the University of Wisconsin System, which supports local jobs and aligns with his stated philosophy of investing in research and development. Advocates should highlight these direct local economic and scientific benefits to underscore the value of NASA science investments.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider gathering specific examples or personal stories from constituents whose jobs or research are directly supported by NASA Science funding at the University of Wisconsin System or Bruker Axs LLC, highlighting the local economic impact and alignment with his focus on job growth.</li>
<li>Explore how increased investment in NASA's Earth science and climate research, particularly projects like PREFIRE/REFIRE at UW-Madison, directly aligns with his stated support for scientific research and investments in future generations.</li>
<li>Look into how NASA Science investments, especially those with direct applications like health and air quality monitoring or climate research, demonstrate efficient use of taxpayer dollars and provide tangible benefits that address broader societal priorities, appealing to his fiscal scrutiny and interest in impactful outcomes.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Appropriations Committee Membership:</strong> As a senior member of the House Committee on Appropriations, Representative Pocan holds a direct role in shaping federal spending, including NASA's budget, and has expressed a desire for budgets to reflect investments in future generations and research. This position allows him to advocate for the significant NASA Science Mission Directorate contracts and grants awarded to the University of Wisconsin System and Bruker Axs LLC in his district. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Direct Local Investment in NASA Science:</strong> His district benefits from substantial NASA Science Mission Directorate contracts and grants, including significant funding for Earth science and planetary science research at the University of Wisconsin System and for specialized equipment at Bruker Axs LLC. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024) These awards directly support local jobs and research within his constituency. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Opposition to Cuts in Scientific Research Funding:</strong> Representative Pocan voted against a partisan government funding bill in March 2025 that proposed over $1 billion in cuts to medical research, including NIH and DoD-funded research, indicating a general opposition to reductions in scientific funding. His office also announced nearly $1 million in federal funding for the University of Wisconsin-Madison's PFAS Center of Excellence for research in March 2024, demonstrating support for local scientific endeavors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>General Support for Research and Development:</strong> Representative Pocan's official budget philosophy emphasizes investing in "job growth through infrastructure, education, and research and development," aligning with the broader goals of NASA's science activities. His alma mater, the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison, is a major research institution in his district, directly benefiting from federal R&amp;D investments. (Biography)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bipartisan Collaboration on Science/Energy Issues:</strong> He co-chairs the Congressional Biofuels Caucus, which relaunched in May 2025 with bipartisan colleagues, demonstrating a willingness to engage in cross-party efforts on science and energy-related policy. Wisconsin's agricultural sector has a direct interest in biofuels policy and related scientific research.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competing Domestic Priorities:</strong> Representative Pocan consistently advocates for robust federal funding for social programs, healthcare, and education, as evidenced by his statements on FY2020 and FY2024 appropriations bills, which are significant competing priorities for discretionary spending within the Appropriations Committee.</li>
<li><strong>Frustration with Appropriations Process:</strong> Representative Pocan has publicly expressed deep dissatisfaction with the current appropriations process, describing it as "demolished" and "fantasy Congress," indicating a challenging legislative environment for securing increased funding for any federal agency, including NASA.</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal Scrutiny and Efficiency Focus:</strong> While generally supportive of federal investments, Representative Pocan's stated budget philosophy emphasizes reducing deficits and cutting "wasteful spending and redundant programs," potentially leading to scrutiny of NASA's budget if programs are not perceived as efficient or essential.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on Earth Science and District-Specific Science:</strong> Representative Pocan's public record and district contracts demonstrate a strong focus on Earth science and specific planetary science research tied to the University of Wisconsin System, which may lead to less emphasis on broader human space exploration initiatives when allocating federal funds.
