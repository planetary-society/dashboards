    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.

<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Van Orden's strong fiscal conservative stance and support for federal spending cuts suggest he may be unreceptive to calls for increased NASA space science funding, especially concerning the proposed 47% cut to the Science Mission Directorate in FY26. His legislative focus on Veterans' Affairs, Agriculture, and Armed Services, coupled with no direct NASA Science contracts or grants in his district over the last three fiscal years, indicates a lack of immediate local economic incentive for such investment.</p>
<p>Additionally, his skepticism regarding certain environmental initiatives could present a challenge for advocating for NASA's Earth science programs. While direct alignment indicators for space science are absent, advocates might still find an opening by emphasizing the broader benefits of American leadership in scientific discovery and technological innovation, though this approach will likely require a significant effort to shift focus from his established priorities.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider framing NASA's space science investments not just as spending, but as strategic national investments that drive innovation, maintain U.S. leadership in critical technologies, and foster economic growth, aligning with broader national interest perspectives.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's scientific endeavors, particularly in areas like advanced propulsion, materials, or remote sensing, contribute to U.S. technological superiority and national security, potentially resonating with his extensive military service and experience.</li>
<li>Look into any local educational institutions, community colleges, or even high schools in his district that have strong STEM programs or students interested in space, to highlight a local connection to the future workforce inspired by NASA science.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Derrick Van Orden</h2>
<ul>
<li>Holds a Bachelor of Science degree from Excelsior University.</li>
<li>Served 26 years in the U.S. Navy, retiring as a Senior Chief SEAL.</li>
<li>Completed five combat deployments during his distinguished military career.</li>
<li>Authored a book and worked as an actor after his military service.</li>
<li>Operated a caf√© in northern Wisconsin before entering Congress.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li>No credible alignment indicators identified in the public record.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ideological Barriers to Government Spending:</strong> Representative Van Orden's voting record and public statements indicate a strong fiscal conservative stance, including support for significant federal spending cuts in the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which could extend to NASA science programs.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Direct Local NASA Economic Ties:</strong> No relevant NASA Science Mission Directorate contracts or grants were found for his district, which may reduce direct local advocacy for increased NASA science investment. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Competing Legislative Priorities:</strong> His primary committee assignments are Veterans' Affairs, Agriculture, and Armed Services, and his public statements and introduced legislation frequently focus on these areas, suggesting a prioritization of other policy domains over civilian space science.</li>
<li><strong>Skepticism towards Climate/Environmental Initiatives:</strong> He supported legislation that curtailed green energy incentives and has expressed views prioritizing domestic energy production, which may indicate a broader skepticism towards funding climate-related science, including Earth science components of NASA's Science Mission Directorate.</li>
