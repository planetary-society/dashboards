<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Fitzgerald's strong fiscal conservatism and consistent advocacy for reduced government spending present a significant challenge to increasing NASA science investments, especially given the proposed FY2026 budget cuts. His expressed skepticism regarding climate science may also extend to NASA's Earth science programs, and his lack of a direct committee assignment overseeing space policy could limit his engagement. Furthermore, the existing NASA contracts in his district are small and not directly tied to core science mission activities, suggesting a limited local economic constituency for this specific ask.</p>
<p>However, there are avenues for engagement. The presence of two NASA contracts in his district, though modest, demonstrates a direct local economic benefit and aligns with his office's support for small businesses and domestic manufacturing in critical technologies. His extensive military background may make him receptive to arguments about how space science contributes to national security and technological leadership. Advocates could highlight how NASA science investments foster innovation, support high-tech jobs, and maintain U.S. competitiveness, aligning with his stated interest in strategic federal investments that benefit local enterprises.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider discussing the NASA contracts awarded to E-Imagedata Corp. and Floor23 Digital LLC in his district, framing NASA science investment as a way to support local small businesses and foster innovation within the community.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's scientific advancements, from Earth observation to advanced propulsion research, contribute to national security and technological superiority, aligning with his military service and support for critical domestic technologies.</li>
<li>Look into presenting NASA science funding as a strategic federal investment that delivers long-term returns in economic growth, technological innovation, and STEM workforce development, addressing his fiscal conservatism by emphasizing value and outcomes.</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Higher Education Connection:</strong> Representative Fitzgerald holds a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh, indicating a connection to the academic community which is a key partner in NASA's scientific research and development. (Wikipedia, 2025; Rep. Fitzgerald House.gov, 2025)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Representative Fitzgerald consistently advocates for reducing government spending and achieving fiscal responsibility, which may limit support for increased NASA science and exploration investments. (Representative Scott Fitzgerald, 2025-02; Quiver Quantitative, 2025-09; Heritage Action For America, 2022-07)</li>
<li><strong>Skepticism on Climate Science:</strong> Representative Fitzgerald has expressed skepticism regarding the conclusions of climate science and has actively opposed climate-related government initiatives, which could extend to NASA's Earth science funding. (Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, 2019-09; Representative Scott Fitzgerald, 2024-04)</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Space Committee Assignment:</strong> Representative Fitzgerald holds no current assignments on House committees directly overseeing NASA or space policy, potentially reducing his direct engagement with and advocacy for space science and exploration. (Authoritative Committee Data, 2025)</li>
<li><strong>Limited Local NASA Science Economic Ties:</strong> The identified NASA contracts in Representative Fitzgerald's district are small in value and not directly tied to the core Science Mission Directorate activities, suggesting a limited direct economic constituency for NASA science. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
