    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.

<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Rep. Grothman's strong fiscal conservatism and consistent advocacy for reduced federal spending present significant challenges to securing his support for increased NASA space science funding, especially given the proposed FY26 budget cuts. His district currently receives no direct economic benefit from NASA science contracts or grants, and he has explicitly voiced skepticism regarding federal spending on climate and Earth science research. Furthermore, his lack of committee assignments related to space or appropriations limits his direct involvement in NASA's budget process.</p>
<p>However, there may be a narrow opening for engagement through his demonstrated interest in Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP). His co-sponsorship of the Safe Airspace for Americans Act and his calls for transparency and declassification of UAP data suggest an interest in scientific inquiry and data collection regarding unexplained observations, which could serve as a starting point for discussing the broader value of fundamental scientific research and exploration.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider connecting NASA's space science activities to national security interests and the pursuit of data transparency, aligning with his co-sponsorship of the Secure Space Act and his advocacy for UAP declassification.</li>
<li>Explore how investments in NASA's space science portfolio, while requiring federal funds, yield long-term returns in technological innovation and national competitiveness, addressing his fiscal conservatism by emphasizing strategic value.</li>
<li>Look into how NASA's broader mission inspires STEM education and workforce development within Wisconsin, potentially connecting to his focus on skills-based education, even without direct district contracts.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Glenn Grothman</h2>
<ul>
<li>Holds a BBA from UW-Madison (1978) and a Juris Doctor from UW Law School (1983).</li>
<li>Practiced as an attorney in West Bend, Wisconsin, following law school.</li>
<li>Served over two decades in the Wisconsin State Assembly and State Senate.</li>
<li>No direct professional or educational background in STEM or space fields.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Support for Space Security Legislation:</strong> Representative Grothman co-sponsored H.R.2458, the Secure Space Act of 2025, which aims to enhance national security in space by restricting satellite licenses to foreign entities of concern. No direct local connection found. (Congress.gov, 2025-03)</li>
<li><strong>Bipartisan Engagement on Aerospace Phenomena:</strong> He co-sponsored the bipartisan Safe Airspace for Americans Act with Rep. Robert Garcia, which seeks to establish a secure process for civilian aviation personnel to report Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) and share these reports with the Department of Defense. No direct local connection found. (Congressman Robert Garcia, 2025-09)</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for Transparency in UAP Data:</strong> Representative Grothman chaired a House hearing on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs) and subsequently called for the declassification of military documents related to UAPs, indicating an interest in scientific inquiry and data transparency regarding unexplained aerial observations. No direct local connection found. (WPR, 2023-07)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of Local NASA Economic Ties:</strong> No relevant NASA Science Mission Directorate contracts or grants for Wisconsin's 6th Congressional District were found in recent fiscal years. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Strong Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Representative Grothman consistently advocates for reduced federal spending and balancing the budget, reintroducing the "Enforce the Caps Act" in June 2025 to extend spending caps and stating that "Americans are fed up with the reckless spending in Washington".</li>
<li><strong>Competing Legislative Priorities:</strong> Representative Grothman's stated priorities on his official website and issue pages focus on areas such as skills-based education, border security, immigration, and healthcare, without mentioning space or science initiatives.</li>
<li><strong>Skepticism Towards Climate/Earth Science Funding:</strong> In 2019, Representative Grothman criticized a government funding bill for spending "too much money," specifically citing increased funding for "NOAA Climate Research" as an example of excessive spending. More recently, in June 2024, he introduced the BIOSAFE Act, stating it "prevents climate change activism from overtaking true conservation of America's wildlife".</li>
<li><strong>Absence of Space-Related Committee Assignments:</strong> Representative Grothman does not hold any current committee assignments related to space, science, or appropriations in the 119th Congress, which may limit his direct engagement with NASA's science portfolio.</li>
