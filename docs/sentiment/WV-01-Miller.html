    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.

<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Miller's fiscal conservatism and lack of direct committee assignments related to space or appropriations present significant challenges for advocating increased NASA space science funding, especially given the proposed FY2026 cuts. Her vote against the CHIPS and Science Act, citing "massive spending," and the absence of direct NASA Science Mission Directorate contracts or grants within her district, suggest a potential reluctance to support large federal science investments without clear local economic ties.</p>
<p>However, there are avenues for engagement. Her office's participation in the CJS community project funding process offers a direct opportunity to connect NASA science to local institutions. Her support for advanced technology, manufacturing, and general research, along with her recognition of the Katherine Johnson IV&amp;V Facility in West Virginia, indicate a potential receptiveness to the broader benefits of scientific endeavors, which could be leveraged to frame NASA science as an investment in technology, jobs, and research that can benefit her constituents.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching local universities, community colleges, or STEM-focused non-profits within West Virginia's 1st Congressional District that could potentially benefit from a NASA science-related community project funding request, aligning with her interest in local investment and education.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's broader science investments contribute to advanced manufacturing techniques, foster innovation that could benefit West Virginia's workforce, or inspire STEM education, connecting to her legislative support for R&amp;D and high-tech industries.</li>
<li>Look into examples of how NASA science missions have historically driven technological advancements and commercial spin-offs, demonstrating a strong return on federal investment that aligns with her concerns about responsible government spending.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Carol D. Miller</h2>
<ul>
<li>Earned a bachelor's degree in history and political science.</li>
<li>Professional background includes experience as an educator.</li>
<li>Owned and managed a bison farm prior to congressional service.</li>
<li>Served multiple terms in the West Virginia House of Delegates.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Engagement with Science Appropriations:</strong> Representative Miller's office accepts community project funding requests for Fiscal Year 2026 under the Commerce, Justice, and Science (CJS) appropriations subcommittee, which funds NASA's Science Mission Directorate. This process allows for federal investment in local research institutions or STEM initiatives within West Virginia's 1st Congressional District.</li>
<li><strong>Support for Advanced Technology and Manufacturing:</strong> Representative Miller co-introduced the bipartisan Fusion Advanced Manufacturing Parity Act in September 2025, aiming to extend tax credits for fusion energy components to accelerate domestic manufacturing and create jobs. This legislative effort supports high-tech manufacturing and research, which could benefit West Virginia's workforce and potentially attract related industries.</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for Research Investment:</strong> Representative Miller co-sponsored a bill in March 2025 to restore the deduction for research and experimental expenditures, indicating a legislative stance supportive of private sector research and development. This policy could encourage research and innovation within West Virginia businesses and universities.</li>
<li><strong>General Support for Research:</strong> In September 2025, Representative Miller was recognized as a "Congressional Champion of the Year" for her advocacy and funding support for medical research related to polycystic kidney disease. This demonstrates a general appreciation for the value of scientific research and its impact on public well-being, which can extend to other scientific fields.</li>
<li><strong>Recognition of NASA's Local Presence:</strong> While from 2019, Representative Miller issued a statement supporting the renaming of the NASA Katherine Johnson IV&amp;V Facility in Fairmont, West Virginia, acknowledging a local hero's contributions to space exploration. The Katherine Johnson IV&amp;V Facility is a significant NASA installation in West Virginia, demonstrating a direct, albeit historical, connection to NASA's mission within the state.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>No Space-Related Committee Assignments:</strong> Representative Miller holds no current assignments on committees directly related to space, science, or appropriations in the 119th Congress, which may limit her direct engagement with NASA's portfolio. [cite: space_committees]</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Local NASA-Related Economic Ties:</strong> No relevant NASA Science Mission Directorate contracts or grants were found for West Virginia's 1st Congressional District, indicating a potential absence of direct local economic incentives for increased NASA science investment. [cite: USAspending, FY2022-FY2024]</li>
<li><strong>Vote Against CHIPS and Science Act:</strong> Representative Miller voted against the CHIPS and Science Act in July 2022, citing concerns about "massive spending" and potential "economic disaster," which suggests a cautious approach to large federal science and technology investments. (Congresswoman Carol Miller, 2022-07)</li>
<li><strong>General Opposition to Government Spending:</strong> Representative Miller has expressed concerns about "spending madness" and "ridiculous expenditures" that she believes do not benefit the country, indicating a broader fiscal conservatism that could impact support for increased federal agency budgets, including NASA. (Fox Business, 2025-02)</li>
<li><strong>Competing Legislative Priorities:</strong> Her stated legislative priorities emphasize job creation, economic diversification, supporting West Virginia's energy industries, and border security, which may lead to a focus on issues other than expanding NASA's science and exploration activities. (House.gov, undated)</li>
