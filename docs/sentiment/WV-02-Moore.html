<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, House Committee on Appropriations</li>
<li>Member, House Committee on Appropriations: Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Moore's fiscal conservatism and past opposition to certain government spending, particularly on climate-related initiatives, suggest he may be skeptical of broad increases for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, especially Earth science. While he has publicly supported the NASA IV&amp;V facility in his district, his broader support for all NASA science programs is not as evident. However, his position on the House Appropriations Committee, specifically the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee, provides a direct avenue for influence over NASA's budget.</p>
<p>Crucially, his district benefits significantly from NASA investments, including substantial contracts for the IV&amp;V program in Fairmont, which supports the reliability of software across all NASA missions, including science and exploration. Additionally, West Virginia University Research Corporation receives grants for advanced space science research, such as heliophysics, and Fairmont State University benefits from STEM education funding. These local economic and research ties offer a strong foundation to advocate that robust NASA science funding, even in the face of proposed cuts, directly benefits his constituents and the state's growing aerospace ecosystem.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider how the local NASA IV&amp;V program and STEM education initiatives in his district directly contribute to the success and reliability of NASA's broader science missions, emphasizing the interconnectedness of these investments.</li>
<li>Explore how specific NASA science research conducted by institutions in his district, such as West Virginia University's work on magnetospheric phenomena, can have implications for national security, space weather prediction, or economic innovation, aligning with his strategic security background and fiscal priorities.</li>
<li>Look into collecting compelling personal stories from constituents in Representative Moore's district who have been directly impacted by or involved in NASA-funded science research, STEM education, or the IV&amp;V program, to illustrate the tangible benefits to his community.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Riley M. Moore</h2>
<ul>
<li>Earned a master's degree in strategic security studies.</li>
<li>Holds an apprenticeship certificate in welding.</li>
<li>Served as a staffer for the U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs.</li>
<li>Worked as a director at Textron, a diversified aerospace and defense company.</li>
<li>Previously served as West Virginia State Treasurer and in the State House.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Appropriations Committee Role:</strong> Representative Moore's position on the House Committee on Appropriations, specifically the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee, provides direct influence over NASA's budget, including its Science Mission Directorate and exploration programs. This role inherently involves bipartisan collaboration in the appropriations process. (House Committee on Appropriations, 119th Congress)</li>
<li><strong>NASA IV&amp;V Program Support:</strong> Significant NASA contracts and grants totaling over $32 million have been awarded to entities in his district, including TMC Technologies of West Virginia Corp and Fairmont State University, for supporting the NASA Independent Verification and Validation (IV&amp;V) program in Fairmont, WV. This program is crucial for ensuring the reliability of software across all NASA missions, including science and exploration. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>University Space Science Research:</strong> West Virginia University Research Corporation in Morgantown has received over $2.5 million in NASA grants for advanced space science research, including developing ultra-compact plasma spectrometers for multi-spacecraft missions and studying magnetospheric phenomena, directly contributing to NASA's Heliophysics science goals. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Aerospace Industry Experience:</strong> Representative Moore's prior experience as a director at Textron, a diversified aerospace and defense company, suggests a professional understanding of and potential support for the aerospace sector, which includes NASA's scientific and exploration endeavors. (Biography, N/A)</li>
<li><strong>STEM Education Investment:</strong> Fairmont State University in his district has received NASA grants totaling over $2.4 million for its Education Resource Center, which promotes Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education in West Virginia, fostering the future workforce for NASA and related industries. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Representative Moore has consistently advocated for reducing government spending and has taken a leadership role in efforts to cut "wasteful spending," which could lead to scrutiny of discretionary programs like NASA science. (Washington Examiner, 2025-02-10; Republican Study Committee, 2025-07-18)</li>
<li><strong>Opposition to Climate-Related Funding:</strong> Representative Moore has publicly opposed "green energy" tax credits and sought to dismantle the Inflation Reduction Act, indicating a potential disinclination to support NASA Earth science activities related to climate research. (Moorefield Examiner, 2025-01-13; Akin Gump, 2024-02-29)</li>
<li><strong>Localized NASA Support:</strong> While Representative Moore has pledged to defend funding for the NASA IV&amp;V facility in his district, his public statements do not broadly champion all NASA Science Mission Directorate activities, suggesting a potentially narrower focus on local economic ties. (Dominion Post, 2025-07-05; USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Defense Spending Priority:</strong> Representative Moore's vote for increased defense appropriations and his background in strategic security studies suggest a potential prioritization of national security-related space initiatives over broader science programs. (Representative Riley Moore, 2025-07-18; Biography)</li>
