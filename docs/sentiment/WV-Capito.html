<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, Senate Committee on Appropriations</li>
<li>Member, Senate Committee on Appropriations: Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee</li>
<li>Member, Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation</li>
<li>Member, Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation: Aviation, Space, and Innovation Subcommittee</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Senator Capito's consistent emphasis on fiscal conservatism and concerns about federal spending, alongside her broad range of competing funding priorities, presents a significant challenge for advocating increased NASA space science funding. Her past disappointment with NASA program management, such as the VIPER cancellation, suggests a critical eye on how funds are utilized, potentially making her wary of new investments, especially in the face of proposed deep cuts to science.</p>
<p>However, her powerful positions on the Senate Appropriations and Commerce Committees give her direct influence over NASA's budget and policy, offering a crucial avenue for advocacy. West Virginia benefits from substantial NASA investment, including direct space science research grants to West Virginia University for heliophysics and advanced instrument development, and significant contracts for the NASA IV&amp;V program, which supports mission assurance critical to all science missions. These local ties, coupled with STEM education initiatives, provide concrete examples of how NASA science benefits her constituents, offering a potential basis for engagement despite her fiscal concerns.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider highlighting how NASA's space science investments directly support STEM education and cutting-edge research at West Virginia institutions like Fairmont State University and WVU, aligning with her background in education and the state's economic interests.</li>
<li>Explore how robust investment in NASA's space science activities, particularly those leveraging West Virginia's NASA IV&amp;V Program, can demonstrate fiscal responsibility and strong program management, addressing her concerns about government efficiency and program execution.</li>
<li>Look into sharing personal stories or local examples of how NASA's space science discoveries inspire West Virginia students and contribute to broader scientific understanding, framing these as strategic investments she can champion through her roles on the Appropriations and Commerce committees.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key Appropriations Role:</strong> As a member of the Senate Committee on Appropriations and its Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee, Senator Capito holds direct budgetary authority over NASA, including its science mission directorate, indicating a critical position to influence funding levels. (Senate.gov, 2025-01-03)</li>
<li><strong>Strategic Commerce Committee Oversight:</strong> Senator Capito's membership on the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and its Aviation, Space, and Innovation Subcommittee provides direct legislative and oversight responsibilities for NASA's programs and policies, including its science portfolio. (Senate.gov, 2025-01-03)</li>
<li><strong>West Virginia University Science Research:</strong> West Virginia University Research Corporation receives substantial NASA grants for space science, including heliophysics and advanced instrument development, demonstrating a direct local connection to NASA's scientific endeavors. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>NASA IV&amp;V Program Support:</strong> The presence of the NASA Independent Verification and Validation (IV&amp;V) Program in West Virginia, supported by significant contracts to entities like TMC Technologies, underscores a local interest in the mission assurance critical to all NASA programs, including science missions. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Local STEM Education Investment:</strong> Fairmont State University receives NASA grants for its Education Resource Center, fostering STEM education in West Virginia, which is vital for developing the future workforce for NASA's scientific and technical needs. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Senator Capito has consistently voiced concerns about federal spending, the national debt, and the need for government efficiency, which could lead to scrutiny of NASA's budget. (WV MetroNews, 2025-03-09; The Dominion Post, 2025-05-09; Senator Kevin Cramer, 2025-02-07)</li>
<li><strong>Competing Funding Priorities:</strong> Her public statements and legislative focus indicate a broad range of priorities for federal funding, including infrastructure, veterans' care, and fossil fuel technology research, which may compete with NASA science for resources. (Senator Shelley Moore Capito, 2024-03-08; Senator Shelley Moore Capito, 2025-07-16)</li>
<li><strong>Disappointment with NASA Program Management:</strong> Senator Capito expressed "very disappointed" with NASA's decision to cancel the VIPER lunar rover, indicating a potential for critical oversight regarding NASA's program execution and decisions. (SpacePolicyOnline, 2024-07-25)</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on Local Economic and Educational Impact:</strong> While supportive of NASA's presence in West Virginia, her strong focus on the local economic and educational benefits of facilities like IV&amp;V and WVU research suggests that NASA science activities without clear in-state ties might receive less prioritized advocacy. (Senator Shelley Moore Capito, 2024-05-30; USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
