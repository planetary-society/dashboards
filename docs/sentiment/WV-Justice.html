<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Senator Justice's strong fiscal conservatism and lack of direct committee assignments related to space policy present significant challenges for advocating for increased NASA space science funding. His public record emphasizes reducing government spending and supporting traditional West Virginia industries, and his skepticism regarding climate science may make him unreceptive to NASA's Earth science initiatives.</p>
<p>However, there is a guarded optimism for engagement due to NASA's substantial economic footprint in West Virginia, totaling over $112 million in science-related contracts and grants over the last three years. His visit to the NASA IV&amp;V facility and support for STEM education demonstrate an appreciation for NASA's local contributions and the talent pipeline. Focusing on how NASA's science mission directly benefits West Virginia's universities and businesses, particularly in areas like heliophysics and planetary science research, could be a more effective approach than advocating for broad, across-the-board increases.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching specific success stories or recent achievements from the NASA IV&amp;V facility in Fairmont, particularly those related to the James Webb Space Telescope, to highlight the critical work Senator Justice has already acknowledged in his state.</li>
<li>Explore how increased investment in NASA's space science activities could directly expand the existing federal contracts and grants to West Virginia universities and businesses, creating more high-tech jobs and fostering economic growth within the state.</li>
<li>Look into how NASA's broader space science research, such as heliophysics or planetary science, drives technological innovation and develops a skilled workforce that could benefit West Virginia's economy beyond traditional industries, appealing to his business and practical background.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About James C. Justice</h2>
<ul>
<li>Earned Bachelor's and Master of Business Administration degrees from Marshall University.</li>
<li>Inherited and managed extensive coal mining and agriculture businesses.</li>
<li>Seven-time national corn growing champion, demonstrating agricultural expertise.</li>
<li>Owner or CEO of over 50 companies, including The Greenbrier resort.</li>
<li>Served as the 36th Governor of West Virginia from 2017 to 2025.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Engagement with Local NASA Facilities:</strong> Senator Justice visited the NASA Independent Verification and Validation (IV&amp;V) facility in Fairmont, West Virginia, in August 2024, acknowledging its "critical work" for NASA missions, including the James Webb Space Telescope, indicating appreciation for NASA's scientific and operational contributions within his state. (Senator Justice Press Release, 2024-08)</li>
<li><strong>Support for STEM Education:</strong> Senator Justice has publicly announced federal funding for STEM education initiatives in West Virginia, which aligns with fostering the talent pipeline necessary for advanced scientific and aerospace endeavors, including NASA's science mission. (Senator Justice Press Release, 2024-03)</li>
<li><strong>Significant NASA Science Research Grants to WVU:</strong> West Virginia University Research Corporation has received substantial NASA grants for developing plasma spectrometers for multi-spacecraft missions and research into magnetic pumping, directly contributing to NASA's heliophysics and planetary science objectives and bringing federal research investment to the state. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Local Industry Support for NASA Programs:</strong> TMC Technologies of West Virginia Corp holds multiple NASA contracts for Independent Verification and Validation (IV&amp;V) support, software tools, and Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) for the Space Geodesy Project, demonstrating a local industrial base contributing to NASA's technical and Earth science missions. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of Direct Space-Related Committee Role:</strong> Senator Justice has no current space-related committee assignments in the 119th Congress, which may limit his direct legislative influence or proactive engagement on NASA's space science and exploration budgets.</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism and Spending Scrutiny:</strong> Senator Justice has consistently emphasized fiscal responsibility, supporting measures to reduce government spending and eliminate perceived waste, stating, "The days of wasting money with zero regard for the taxpayer are over".</li>
<li><strong>Strong Focus on Traditional Industries and State Economy:</strong> His public record prioritizes supporting West Virginia's traditional energy sectors (coal, oil, natural gas), job creation, and state-level economic development, which may lead to less emphasis on federal space science investments.</li>
<li><strong>Skepticism Regarding Climate Science:</strong> Senator Justice has expressed equivocation on the scientific consensus of global warming and has criticized "radical fantasies of the far-left climate cult" in energy policy discussions, potentially indicating less support for NASA's Earth science research.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Public Advocacy for Broader Space Science Growth:</strong> While West Virginia benefits from NASA contracts, Senator Justice's public statements and legislative priorities do not prominently feature advocacy for expanding NASA's broader space science activities (astrophysics, planetary science, heliophysics, biological and physical sciences) or exploration programs beyond existing local ties.</li>
