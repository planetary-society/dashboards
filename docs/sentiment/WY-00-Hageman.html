    Note: This analysis uses AI to help identify potential outreach strategies for space science issues. Because it uses AI, it is important to understand the sources and limitations of this analysis.
    Space-related committee assignments (if present), and additional sources (if present), are from congress.gov and a direct output of a targeted web search.
    Opportunities, challenges, overall summary, and preparation recommendations are products of AI analyses. The biography uses AI to summarize key aspects of the member's Wikipedia page.

<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Representative Hageman's fiscal conservatism and skepticism towards federal spending, particularly on issues related to climate science, present significant challenges for advocating for increased NASA space science funding. Her focus on reducing the national debt and opposition to "unchecked growth in deficit spending" suggest she will scrutinize new appropriations. Additionally, her lack of a direct committee role in space policy means her influence on NASA's budget is less direct, and her legislative priorities often center on energy and local issues.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, there are potential avenues for engagement. Her co-sponsorship of legislation promoting interagency research collaboration and her stated support for "impactful, groundbreaking scientific research" indicate a potential receptiveness to the scientific merit of NASA's work. Crucially, the University of Wyoming in her district has received over $2 million in NASA science grants over the past three years, supporting diverse research from astrophysics to biological sciences. Highlighting these direct local benefits and the scientific excellence they represent could be a compelling argument for continued investment in NASA's science mission.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching the specific NASA science grants awarded to the University of Wyoming, focusing on how these projects benefit Wyoming's economy, research capacity, or address issues relevant to the state, such as water resources or atmospheric science.</li>
<li>Explore how increased investment in NASA's space science aligns with Representative Hageman's stated support for merit-based, groundbreaking scientific research and interagency collaboration, as evidenced by her co-sponsorship of the DOE and NASA Interagency Research Coordination Act.</li>
<li>Look into how NASA's space science activities contribute to American technological leadership, foster innovation, and maintain national competitiveness in advanced fields, framing the investment as crucial for the nation's future and economic strength.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Harriet M. Hageman</h2>
<ul>
<li>Holds a Bachelor of Science and Juris Doctor from the University of Wyoming.</li>
<li>Career as a trial attorney, including water rights litigation for Wyoming.</li>
<li>No military service or direct space/STEM professional experience noted.</li>
<li>Vocal supporter of the fossil fuel industry and energy independence.</li>
<li>Grew up on a ranch; father served in the Wyoming House of Representatives.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Support for Interagency Research Collaboration:</strong> Representative Hageman co-sponsored H.R.1368, the "DOE and NASA Interagency Research Coordination Act," which provides statutory authority for collaborative research and development between the Department of Energy and NASA.</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on Merit-Based Scientific Research:</strong> Representative Hageman has publicly advocated for federal research grants to be awarded based on "impactful, groundbreaking scientific research," indicating a focus on the scientific merit of projects.</li>
<li><strong>Local NASA Science Grants:</strong> The University of Wyoming, located in her district, has received multiple NASA grants for science activities, including research in biological and physical sciences, Earth science, and astrophysics. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Interest in National Technological Competitiveness:</strong> During a House Judiciary Committee hearing on artificial intelligence, Representative Hageman questioned the need for the United States to "stay ahead in the race" in AI, suggesting an interest in fostering American leadership in advanced technology and scientific fields.</li>
<li><strong>Higher Education Background:</strong> Representative Hageman holds a Bachelor of Science and a Juris Doctor from the University of Wyoming, demonstrating a foundational connection to academic institutions and their research endeavors. (Biography)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Skepticism towards Earth Science:</strong> Representative Hageman has publicly criticized climate change policies as "extreme overreach" and "climate lunacy," and introduced legislation to prevent U.S. funds for climate reparations, indicating potential skepticism towards NASA's Earth science activities.</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> She consistently advocates for reducing the national debt and opposes "unchecked growth in deficit spending," suggesting a general inclination to scrutinize and potentially limit appropriations for federal agencies, including NASA.</li>
<li><strong>Opposition to DEI in Research Funding:</strong> Hageman introduced the "Abolishing Woke Awards for Research and Development (AWARD) Act" to prohibit federal research grants from using Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) criteria, which could impact NASA's grant programs if perceived to incorporate such benchmarks.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Direct Space Committee Role:</strong> Representative Hageman holds no current space-related committee assignments in the 119th Congress, limiting her direct formal influence on NASA's space science and exploration programs. (Authoritative Committee Data)</li>
<li><strong>Prioritization of Energy and Local Issues:</strong> Her legislative focus and public statements heavily emphasize the fossil fuel industry, energy independence, and local infrastructure projects, potentially indicating a lower prioritization of federal investment in basic space science.</li>
