<h2>NASA-related Committee Assignments or Caucuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Member, Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Senator Lummis's strong commitment to fiscal conservatism and her skepticism regarding climate-related federal spending pose significant challenges to advocating for increased NASA space science funding, particularly given the proposed 47% cut which could impact Earth science. Her legislative focus on digital assets also suggests competing priorities that may overshadow space science. Furthermore, Wyoming lacks a major NASA industry presence, limiting direct economic arguments for large-scale projects beyond university grants.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, there are opportunities for engagement. Her role on the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee and her co-leadership on the bipartisan ORBITS Act demonstrate an understanding of space policy and the importance of safeguarding space assets. Most importantly, her alma mater, the University of Wyoming, is a significant recipient of NASA science grants, providing a direct, tangible connection to the benefits of space science research within her state.</p>
<h2>Preparation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider researching the specific research outcomes or potential future applications of the NASA science grants awarded to the University of Wyoming, Senator Lummis's alma mater, to highlight direct local benefits and align with her background in science.</li>
<li>Explore how NASA's space science activities, such as Earth observation for weather forecasting or astronomical research, contribute to national security, critical infrastructure protection, or technological advancement, aligning with her co-leadership of the ORBITS Act and her committee's focus.</li>
<li>Look into examples of how NASA space science investments have historically generated significant economic returns, technological spin-offs, or advanced critical national capabilities, enabling advocates to frame increased funding as a fiscally responsible and strategic investment.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Cynthia M. Lummis</h2>
<ul>
<li>Earned Bachelor of Science degrees in animal science and biology from University of Wyoming.</li>
<li>Practiced law; served in the Wyoming House, Senate, and as State Treasurer.</li>
<li>Previously served four terms as U.S. Representative for Wyoming.</li>
<li>Chaired the U.S. House Science Subcommittee on Energy.</li>
<li>Strong proponent of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency; holds personal investments.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Support for Space Debris Mitigation:</strong> Senator Lummis co-led the bipartisan Orbital Sustainability (ORBITS) Act in May 2025, which directs NASA and other agencies to address space debris, emphasizing the importance of safeguarding satellites for national security, weather forecasting, and communications. (Lummis.senate.gov, 2025-05)</li>
<li><strong>Membership on Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee:</strong> As a member of this committee, Senator Lummis participates in oversight of NASA, including a September 2025 hearing that underscored the importance of continuing NASA programs for national security and technological advancement. (Senate.gov, 2025-09)</li>
<li><strong>Local NASA Science Grants:</strong> The University of Wyoming, Senator Lummis's alma mater, has received multiple NASA grants for scientific research, including studies on tardigrade desiccation tolerance, cloud feedback, and interstellar dust. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Favorable Committee Action on NASA Authorization:</strong> The Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, where Senator Lummis serves, favorably ordered the NASA Transition Authorization Act of 2025 (S.933) to be reported without amendment in March 2025, indicating support for NASA's authorized programs. (Congress.gov, 2025-03)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiscal Conservatism:</strong> Senator Lummis consistently emphasizes fiscal responsibility and reining in wasteful spending, which may lead to caution regarding significant increases in government appropriations, including for NASA.</li>
<li><strong>Competing Policy Focus (Digital Assets):</strong> Senator Lummis dedicates significant legislative effort and public statements to digital asset policy, including introducing comprehensive legislation and discussing a strategic Bitcoin reserve, indicating a strong competing priority that may divert attention from space science advocacy.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Direct NASA Industry Presence:</strong> Wyoming lacks major NASA centers or large aerospace industry contractors, potentially limiting direct economic advocacy for large-scale NASA projects beyond university research grants. (USAspending, FY2022-FY2024)</li>
<li><strong>Prior Energy Science Focus:</strong> Her previous role chairing the U.S. House Science Subcommittee on Energy indicates a historical focus within science policy that may not directly align with broader space science or exploration priorities. (Biography)</li>
<li><strong>Skepticism of Climate-Related Spending:</strong> Senator Lummis has been critical of federal climate funding, deriding "unrealistic measures to cut carbon emissions" and suggesting unspent climate funds be used for other priorities, which could extend to NASA's Earth science activities.</li>
